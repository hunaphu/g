<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p><strong>Observations and definitions</strong></p>
<p>There is one Archimedean solid based on the tetrahedron, 6 on the cube and 6 on the dodecahedron. These basic polyhedra have faces with different numbers of sides, but all have 3 faces meeting at each vertex.</p>
<p>In the drawing below we pick one pair of faces (top/bottom) of the cube and dodecahedron and call them polar (north/south). The other faces are equatorial. Both shapes have twice as many vertices and 3 times as many edges as they have equatorial faces.</p>
<p>The cube has 4 equatorial faces arranged inline around the equator. We can count all the edges &amp; vertices of the cube by considering the edges to the north, west and south of each equatorial face, which form a C shape, meeting at the northwest and southwest vertices. Two such C shapes in green and blue are shown in the drawing.</p>
<p>The dodecahedron has 10 equatorial faces zigzagging around the equator, 5 to the north and 5 to the south. We can count all vertices and edges by forming a C shape in a similar way, from the northwest and southwest vertices and three adjacent edges of each equatorial face. Five such C shapes are shown in the drawing: green &amp; blue to the north, and brown, red &amp; purple to the south. We call the north vertices &amp; edges of the north faces and the south vertices &amp; edges of the south faces the 10 polar vertices/edges, as they border the polar faces in a similar way to the cube. We call the remaining 10 vertices &amp; north/south edges equatorial vertices &amp; edges as they form a ring at the equator.</p>
<p>Additionally the west edges can be referred to as &quot;vertical&quot; edges (though they are not strictly vertical for the dodecahedron.)</p>
<p><em><strong>Fig: Edges and vertices forming C shapes around equatorial faces</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/yr4uSGT0.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/yr4uSGT0.png" alt="Edges and vertices forming C shapes around equatorial faces" /></a></p>
<p>In the Archimedean solids we find: &quot;main&quot; faces corresponding to the faces of the cube or dodecahedron; triangular or hexagonal &quot;vertex&quot; faces corresponding to the vertices of the cube or dodecahedron, and (in some cases) &quot;edge&quot; faces corresponding to the edges of the cube or dodecahedron. The rhombicuboctahedron and truncated cuboctahedron have square &quot;edge faces&quot;. The snub cube is derived from the rhombicuboctahedron by givng the main faces a slight twist, converting each of the square edge faces into a pair of triangles. The same applies for the equivalent dodecahedron derivatives.</p>
<p><strong>Repeating units</strong></p>
<p>The nets are built up using repeating units corresponding to one equatorial face, the vertex faces (and if applicable, edge faces) from the C shape mentioned above, plus a polar face (only plotted twice per polyhedron.)</p>
<p>At the start of the code, one of several magic strings is assigned to <code>:p</code> corresponding to the required polyhedron. There are magic strings for the tetrahedron and all 6 polyhedra based on the dodecahedron, which encode the various polygons that need to be drawn to form 1/10th of the net.</p>
<p>There are no magic strings for polyhedra based on the cube. For these, the magic string for the analogous polyhedron with dodecahedral symmetry is used, and the pentagons &amp; decagons are converted to squares &amp; octagons by multiplying the number of sides by 0.8, giving a repeating unit corresponding to 1/4th of the net.</p>
<p>The repeating units are shown below, with the first polygon drawn shown in blue and the last polygon drawn (which is always the polar face) shown in yellow. For the snub polyhedra, the first polygon is also an alternate polar face and is shown in green. Note that the repeating units are identical for the 6 polyhedra based on the dodecahedron and the 6 analogous polyhedra based on the cube, except that the main faces are squares instead of pentagons.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fig: Repeating units</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/VCyWTMGt.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/VCyWTMGt.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>The ascii code <code>:c</code> for each character encodes for one polygon. <code>(int :c/4)-21</code> recovers the number of sides, between -10 and 10. Positive numbers correspond to clockwise rotation, negative sides correspond to anticlockwise rotation. c%4 recovers a number between 0 and 3, which corresponds to a number of additional sides which can be drawn to move the turtle.  By alternating drawing clockwise and anticlockwise, chains of polygons can be drawn. Small side branches are also possible by drawing a polygon with <code>:c%4 &gt; 0</code>, drawing a branch polygon with <code>:c%4 = 0</code>, then drawing the first polygon with <code>:c%4 &gt; 0</code> to move the turtle to a different side of the polygon. The code <code>fd 16 rt 360/:e</code> is what actually draws one side of an e sided polygon (with a sidelength of 16, chosen because cos 30 is almost exactly 7/8.)</p>
<p><strong>Rotation, reflection and translation of repeating units</strong></p>
<p>The repeating units are drawn by looping the variable <code>:a</code> from 0 to 3 or 0 to 9. <code>:s</code> is +1 for even iterations and -1 for odd iterations and is used to reverse the direction of the turns during drawing so that a reflected version is produced. This is essential for the polyhedra based on the dodecahedron due to its zigzag of equatorial vertices. It is not essential for all the polyhedra based on the cube, but is done anyway as it helps place the polar faces correctly. It is very helpful in correctly orientating the units the cuboctahedron and truncated octahedron.</p>
<p>The builtin <code>seth</code> is used to set the heading of the turtle before plotting each repeating unit. the argument for seth is stored in a magic string (one character per polyhedron) and is multiplied by <code>:s</code> to get the correct angle after reflection</p>
<p>Reflection is not applied for the snub polyhedra, which have no reflectional symmetry. The variable <code>:k</code> is 0 for a snub polyhedron and 1 otherwise. The expression used to calculate <code>:s</code> is <code>-1^(:a*:k)</code> (multiply <code>:a</code> by <code>:k</code> and raise -1 to that power.)</p>
<p>The repeating units are positioned by translation by <code>setxy</code>. The correct amount of vertical translation is applied to the y value using a magic string with one character per polyhedron. Vertical translation is used due to the fact that <code>seth</code> considers angle zero to be upward. Zigzagging is applied by extracting an x offset from another magic string (one character per polyhedron) and multiplying by <code>:a%2</code>. Hence the centreline of the net is the average of zero and the number in the magic string. Some degree of zigzag for 12 out of 13 polyhedra (even those based on the cube - only the snub cube is excepted.) Although some of the cube nets are quite symmetrical, the start point of the repeating units is not generally on the centreline.</p>
<p><em><strong>Observation:</strong> The repeating units for the dodecahedron derivatives with edge faces (rhombicosidodecahedron, truncated rhombicosidodecahedron and snub dodecahedron) are aligned equatorial edge face to vertex face on a hexagonal grid (with slight rotation for the snub.) For the analogous polyhedra based on the cube, the alignment is main face to vertical edge face. This follows the observation above that the faces of the cube sit at the equator (separated by vertical edges) while on the dodecahedron it is the equatorial vertices that sit at the equator (joined by the equatorial edges.) The icosidodecahedron is linked via its equatorial main faces and equatorial vertex faces. The cuboctahedron is linked through its main faces and some of its vertex faces (alternating north/south.) The truncated icosahedron and octahedron are similar but only link through the vertex faces. The truncated dodecahedron and cube follow a similar pattern to typical nets for the regular dodecahedron and cube: equatorial edges for the dodecahedron, vertical edges for the cube.</em></p>
<p><strong>Suppression of unwanted polar faces</strong></p>
<p>In general we only want to plot the last face from the magic string (the polar face) twice. We do this on the first 2 iterations of the <code>:a</code> loop. For the snub polyhedra we only want to do it once. This is achieved using the final condition in loop <code>for[b 1+0^:k*(:a&lt;&gt;1) (count :p)-(:a&gt;:k)]</code> where <code>count :p</code> is the total number of polygons encoded in <code>:p</code>, and <code>:k</code> is 0 for a snub polyhedron or 1 for any other. Also, for snub polyhedra an alternate polar face is encoded at the beginning of <code>:p</code> and we only want to plot this on iteration 1. This is achieved by the initial condition <code>1+0^:k*(:a&lt;&gt;1)</code> where <code>^</code> is raise to a power.</p>
<p>The truncated tetrahedron is plotted in the exact same way as the cube derivatives, with 4 iterations fof the <code>:a</code> loop, except that we do not want to plot any polar faces. The magic string for the truncated tetrahedron therefore contains two copies of the character used to plot the triangle, so that the triangle is drawn twice on the first two iterations of the a loop instead of drawing an additional polar face.</p>

<p>The shapes are quite unusual :) but correct as far as I can tell (let me know if you find any errors). They were generated (in a separate program) by constructing the face graph and cutting cycles in a DFS.</p>
<p>I'm sure this can be golfed quite a lot more using e.g. python and turtle.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> oops, the last case was self-intersecting a bit. I fixed the code (by hand), here's the updated image:</p>
