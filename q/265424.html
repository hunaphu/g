<p>I couldn't find much clever golfing to do here.  The load-store architecture hurts here as we need three instructions to do a read-modify-write of memory.</p>
<p>(Atomic <code>LDADD</code> is a possibility if we have ARMv8.2, despite being much more inefficient, but we'd need another instruction to negate the value from <code>a</code> as there is no <code>LDSUB</code>, and it wouldn't set the flags so that would cost one more.  If the condition to jump were <code>*b - *a &lt; 0</code> instead of <code>&lt;=</code>, we could branch on the sign bit with <code>tbz</code>. <code>LDADD</code> also lacks the fancy addressing modes that we want to use.)</p>
<p>I took the same interpretation as Peter Cordes that signed overflow in the subtraction is undefined behavior, so that we can branch on <code>*b &lt;= *a</code> instead of <code>*b - *a &lt;= 0</code>.</p>
<p>It was also unclear what should happen if you jump to a negative address.  This version will consider it successful termination.  If you allow it to be UB, you can shave off one instruction (4 bytes) by changing the second argument (in <code>x1</code>) to be a pointer to the end of the array, instead of a length count, and then just change the loop condition to <code>cmp x2, x1; b.hs next_insn</code>.</p>
<p>I considered keeping an integer instead of a pointer as the program counter.  It saves the <code>add</code> instruction to compute the new pc for <code>c</code>, but costs another one to add 3 for the no-jump case, because loads can't post-increment an index register.</p>
<p>I also had some thoughts about using 32-bit cells so that all three elements of the instruction could be loaded with one 128-bit <code>ldp</code>, but unpacking from the high half of a 64-bit register is too much extra work.</p>

<p>This is a plain Z80 subroutine called via <code>call</code> with registers as parameters. This subleq processor is 8-bit, both in data and addressing. Jump locations are interpreted as unsigned rather than signed, although comparisons are still signed. Do note that values are not exactly two's complement as <code>$80</code> is interpreted as positive rather than negative; however, the challenge does not specify this, and it should not affect the Turing-completeness of the implementation.</p>
<p>Example code to call the subroutine with the provided data:</p>
<pre><code>    ld hl, prog_start
    ld d, prog_end - prog_start

<div id="pu6" class="pu"><h1>x86(-64) machine code, 17 bytes</h1>
<p>A function that <strong>simulates a SUBLEQ machine with 8-bit cells</strong>, returning to the caller with the array modified.  Callable from C with the x86-64 SysV calling convention as <code>void subleq8(int8_t *end, int8_t *aligned_start);</code> (Like a <code>.begin()</code> / <code>.end()</code> range, the end pointer start+length.)</p>
<p><code>start</code> must be aligned by 256 so its low 8 bits are <code>0</code>.  This allows indexing the array by replacing the low byte with x86 partial-register stuff, instead of needing to zero-extend the guest byte into a separate register and use an indexed addressing mode.  (A similar trick is useful on 8-bit systems like AVR where two 8-bit registers form a 16-bit pointer: if you don't cross a 256-byte boundary, you can skip <code>adc</code> into the high byte; if the array is aligned by 256 you can just replace the low byte.)</p>
<p><code>start</code> must be in the low 32 bits of virtual address space, e.g. the x32 ABI, mmap(MAP_32BIT), or simply a static array (e.g. in <code>.data</code>) in a non-PIE Linux executable.  Or if you run the same machine code in 32-bit mode.</p>
<pre><code>               ;;; array in ESI, aligned by 256 (so the low byte can be replaced to index into it)
               ;;; end-pointer (array+len) in EDI
               
               subleq8:
 89F0              mov  eax, esi               ; copy high bytes to EAX so merging a new low byte generates an address

               .nextinst:
 AC                lodsb                       ; fetch address A into AL, forming an x86 pointer in RAX

</code></pre>
<p>Instead of checking for the subtraction result being negative or zero, we actually check if <code>[b]</code> was less-or-equal than <code>[a]</code> before the subtraction, using FLAGS set by the <code>sub</code> instruction (like <code>cmp</code>).  This is the same as checking the result against <code>0</code> if signed overflow didn't happen, otherwise it's the opposite.  With Python arbitrary-precision integers, signed overflow is impossible.  (There is no <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/jcc" rel="noreferrer">x86 FLAGS condition</a> for negative-or-zero so it would take an extra 3 bytes, either for <code>cmp byte [rax], 0</code> or for <code>cmovs</code> + <code>cmove</code> instead of <code>cmovle</code>.  Like most ISAs with signed-compare conditions, x86 does have a <code>le</code> less-or-equal condition that checks <code>SF != OF || ZF</code> in the same predicate.)</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer#Subtract_and_branch_if_less_than_or_equal_to_zero" rel="noreferrer">even Wikipedia</a> defines a SUBLEQ OISC in terms of comparing against zero, rather than the usual computer-architecture meaning of a less-or-equal condition after a subtraction.  :/  If signed wrap-around (overflow) doesn't happen, the two variants of the architecture are equivalent.   Unless / until there's a test-case that requires checking the sign of the result instead of the LE condition generated by subtraction, I'm going to leave my answer this way.  I'm pretty confident this is also Turing complete and probably not significantly different for implementing most basic arithmetic, if any of that comes near signed overflow.</p>
<p><strong>The max program length is 127 or 128 bytes</strong> if you want <em>any</em> negative address to end the program. 126 is the highest multiple of 3, if your program doesn't do misaligned jumps and doesn't want to keep some data past the end of the last instruction. (It effectively treats the program counter as unsigned, looping <code>do {} while(PC &lt; end)</code>, so a negative program counter is an unsigned number in the upper half of range, above any signed-positive length.)  Otherwise, max program length = 255, exiting only on PC=255, although that's untested and rollover of the high bytes of RSI could happen, but maybe only with misaligned jumps, e.g. to PC=254 so fetching the full instruction would get to PC=257, with <code>lodsb</code> carrying into the higher bytes of RSI.</p>
<p>(With len limited to 128, misaligned jumps are no problem.  e.g. a program might use its first instruction to jump to address <code>4</code> and then use the first 4 bytes purely as data, eventually falling off the end when PC = 128.)</p>
<p>Tested with the test-case in the question; it's correct for that but it doesn't AFAIK test for off-by-one errors (<code>&lt;=</code> vs. <code>&lt;</code> in the SUBLEQ operation), or for exiting via a taken branch to a negative or past-the-end address.  I <em>think</em> my program is correct, e.g. <code>cmovle</code> treats &quot;equal&quot; the same as &quot;less-than&quot;, and the test-case does exercise less-than causing the branch to be taken.</p>
<h1>x86(-64) machine code, 21 bytes</h1>
<p><strong>Simulates a 32-bit SUBLEQ machine</strong>.  Writing a 32-bit register zero-extends to the full 64-bit register so even if we were willing to align the SUBLEQ program by 2^32 that wouldn't all the same partial-register trickery.</p>
<p>Even starting at absolute address <code>0</code> wouldn't work, because SUBLEQ addressing is in terms of cells, like a word-addressable machine.  But x86 is a byte-addressable architecture, so SUBLEQ addresses have to be scaled by 4 to get x86-64 byte offsets since we're using 4-byte cells.</p>
<p>In x86-64 SysV, <code>void subleq32(int32_t *end, int32_t *start)</code>.  I think the <code>start</code> pointer might need to be 4GiB aligned to properly handle all jumps to negative addresses, since we only compare the low 32 bits after doing <code>x86_address = base + target*4</code>.  With a larger base, some negative targets could wrap.  And due to the scaling by 4, the most negative value we detect is <code>-2^30</code>.  We shift out the high bits of some larger numbers, although some larger-magnitude numbers will happen to have a bit that gets shifted to the sign-bit position, too.</p>
<p>So maybe it's only really able to correctly simulate a 30-bit SUBLEQ machine, or 29-bit or something.  But still much more than 8-bit, which is the point.</p>

<h2>x86(-64) machine code for a byte-addressable SUBLEQ, 17 bytes</h2>
<p>Untested, but it's the same logic as the 8-bit version, with the same instructions except 32-bit operand-size.  (So writing full registers instead of merging into the low byte).</p>
<p>The SUBLEQ program's cells are 4 SUBLEQ addresses wide, matching the x86 addressing.  One way to make the test program run the same is to scale all its starting values by 4, like <code>12, 16, 12 | 24, 52, 36 | ...</code>.  If you do misaligned load/store or jumps, it will expose the fact that it's a little-endian machine.  (SUBLEQ doesn't have byte loads, only word loads.)</p>
<p>This requires the array to start at absolute address <code>0</code>.  Or in 32-bit mode, <code>DS:0</code>, so you could plausibly imagine some segmented code that sets the DS segment base for passing arrays.  (Some &quot;string&quot; instructions use the ES segment, but <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/lods:lodsb:lodsw:lodsd:lodsq" rel="noreferrer"><code>lodsd</code> uses <code>ds:esi</code></a>).</p>

 31F6              xor  esi, esi               ; start address = 0, can't justify having the caller pass it since we depend on it being 0

<p>A 16-bit version of this would be highly plausible in 16-bit mode where segmentation is normal, then it wouldn't be too weird to take an array at <code>ds:0</code>.  Same machine code except for the ModRM.rm field that encodes <code>[rax]</code>... except there is no <code>[ax]</code> addressing mode, only <code>[bx]</code>, <code>[di]</code>, or <code>[si]</code> for single-register <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53866854/differences-between-general-purpose-registers-in-8086-bx-works-cx-doesnt">16-bit addressing modes</a> that use the DS segment.  So that might cost a couple 1-byte <code>xchg</code> instructions, perhaps with BX.</p>
<p>16-bit addressing modes don't allow a scale factor so they're not very convenient for a word-addressable SUBLEQ.</p>
