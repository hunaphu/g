<pre class="lang-javascript prettyprint-override"><code>eval("[...]".length.toString(36)+".log('Hello, World!')")
</code></pre>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>The first string inside the eval statement is 27612545666 chars long. This number is the decimal representation of &quot;console&quot; in base 36.</p>

<p>Where <code>w{n}</code> means <code>w</code> repeated <code>n</code> times. BF is cyclical mod 256, so instead of going &quot;up&quot; 72 to get to &quot;H&quot;, you can go &quot;down&quot; 184 to get there. <code>-{227}</code> just adds 29 to get to &quot;e&quot;, and so on with these basic building blocks, except for the double &quot;ll&quot;. I made a counter set to -2 (254), then add 1 both times to run the output (<code>.</code>) twice.</p>

<p>No, I did not force TIO to execute that many bytes of code :) I hardcoded the value in. See the TIO link for the exact number of characters.</p>
<pre><code>³!¤“...”LbỌ - Main niladic link
   “...”    - The real meat of the program. a very long string of characters. See the TIO link for the exact number of characters
        L   - Takes the length of the string
³!¤      b  - Convert from base 10 to base 100!
          Ọ - Turn the array into a string
</code></pre>
<p>Irreducible because:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you omit a character in the literal, the resultant number will be wrong</li>
<li>If you change ³!¤, the base conversion will be incorrect</li>
<li>If you omit any other byte, the program will either not print &quot;Hello, World!&quot; or do strange things</li>
</ul>
<p>Funny that Jelly is a golfing language, and yet you can make such a long irreducible program for the simplest of things.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks @Bubbler for fixing my output format and adding some bytes

</code></pre>
<p>old:</p>
<pre><code> FromCharacterCode[StringLength[&quot;aaaa...aaaa&quot;]~IntegerDigits~Hyperfactorial[Hyperfactorial[3]]]
</code></pre>
<p>Where &quot;aaaa...aaaa&quot; is <code>FromDigits[ToCharacterCode[&quot;Hello, World!&quot;], Hyperfactorial[Hyperfactorial[3]]]</code> a's long. That's about 10<sup>128433</sup> digits long. The key here is that the &quot;W&quot; is character code 114, which means the base of the number can't even drop below 114, or the code won't output properly. I believe <code>Hyperfactorial</code> to be the fastest growing function, with <code>Hyperfactorial[3] = 108</code> and <code>Hyperfactorial[4] = 27648</code>, meaning that nesting 2 Hyperfactorial is the maximum number, and any attempt to reduce it will drop the base below 114.</p>
<p>Edit:
This is not the biggest answer, <code>Nest[Hyperfactorial, 10, 9]</code> as a base would be bigger, as it cannot be reduced to a number greater than 114. Sadly, I'm not at the level to even start getting close bounds, so lets go with a very poor lower bound, which would still be a valid score.</p>
<p><code>Ω(Log10[Hyperfactorial[x]])</code> is <code>x</code>, where <code>Ω</code> is lower bound notation. It's really  closer to x<sup>2</sup>, but compared to the power of logerithms, they may as well be the same. This means that Hyperfactorial nested 9 times is at minimum (10)↑↑(10). The number of characters is 10 to this power, so (10)↑↑(11).</p>

<p>How? The big pile of digits in the original code is just this string but we interpret the bit sequence given by its ASCII encoding as a binary representation of a number (this is obtained using <code>int.from_bytes(...,'big')</code>, <code>'big'</code> for endianness). Then we get the string by the inverse method <code>.to_bytes(length,'big')</code>. We use a trick to meet the requirements and instead of having the length in decimal we use <code>ord(&quot;ŵ&quot;)</code> which evaluates to <code>373</code> because that's the Unicode codepoint of <code>ŵ</code>.</p>
<p><code>arrows</code> computes <span class="math-container">\$A \uparrow^N B\$</span> using a formula from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The number <span class="math-container">\$I\$</span> is given by <code>int.from_bytes(b'Hello, World!', 'big')</code>.
This way, <code>Hello, World!</code> is encoded in that very long string of ones.
Then we decode this string by inverting the function with which it was defined.</p>
<h2>Why it's irreducible</h2>
<p>It's not very a formal proof, but I think it works. The fact that my code structure is very simple helps.</p>
<p>To print <code>Hello, World!</code> we need to call some sort of printing function. Clearly, the only hope for that is by the <code>exec</code> function. The doc says that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>exec</code> must take a string or a code object</a>.  Well, actually we are passing a <code>bytes</code> object which also works. If it didn't work, we could just use <code>.decode('ascii')</code>, but because <code>bytes</code> work this would make a reduction possible. So to obtain such an object (byte, code or string) we will need to use either the quotation marks or the <code>to_bytes</code> method. There's only a few options with quotation marks and none of them work. So we must use <code>to_bytes</code>.
Because we encoded the string length as <code>ord(&quot;ŵ&quot;)</code>, any change to the parameters of <code>to_bytes</code> will break the program. So we must change the big integer that encodes our code. It's statistically obvious, but if you want you can also computationally check that if we delete any single character or a pair or a triplet of characters from it, we will get garbage, and for sure not a working code that prints <code>Hello, World!</code>. If we delete 4 or more characters, we will get an integer more than 256 times smaller. Because we interpret that with the same length (<code>ord(&quot;ŵ&quot;)</code>), we will get a null byte, and <code>exec</code> will throw <code>ValueError: source code string cannot contain null bytes</code>.</p>
<h2>Extra</h2>
<p>Code for generating answers:</p>
<pre><code>code=b'''
&lt;insert code to be executed&gt;
'''
print('Q=...')
print('exec(('+str(int.from_bytes(code,&quot;big&quot;))+').to_bytes(ord(&quot;'+chr(len(code))+'&quot;),&quot;big&quot;))')
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>chr(len(code))</code> won't always exist (especially for very long codes), so this answer doesn't easily generalize to any very fast function. In my opinion if someone comes up with a way to do it for any code this question will be ultimately &quot;solved&quot; (edit: actually, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higman%27s_lemma" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Higman's lemma</a> implies that the score on this question is bounded, so this is impossible).</p>

<p>So where that <code>...</code> is, replace it with <span class="math-container">\$3.3 * 10^{8912898}\$</span> <code>0</code>s. Then, add a <code>!</code> after those 0s.

<p>I owe a special thanks to @JoKing for helping me generate a truly irreducible score... it took me a while to understand it, but it got there in the end.</p>
<h2>Why can't this be reduced?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove any of the leading 0s, and then it has the wrong number at the start, meaning that the wrong letters will be printed</li>

<p>This pattern is not reducible (ignore the spaces, they are used to align things so that the modifier characters are visible, as they don't combine with non-alpha characters; <code>.</code> are NOP code points that can be subject to alteration). See <a href="https://tio.run/##KyrNy0z@/1/pTI@WkvbD7fuADG09PSCDSw8ItICYKw9IKIEYIBFDGMMezDg7QU9bT0lLKe9MExeEyjs7AWjA//8A" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this tio</a> for a version without and <a href="https://tio.run/##KyrNy0z@/1/pTI@CloKSgvbD7fsUQBxtBT0FPRCHS08BArWgNFcelKEEE4CpMEQXsIcLnJ0ApLTBmkDW5J1pUuBCMPOA0mALFf7/BwA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this one</a> for full accurate placement with spaces. </p>

<p>The pattern uses <a href="https://tio.run/##KyrNy0z@/1/pTI@WkvbD7fuADG09PSBDDwi0gDgPiJX0IMAQStuDiLMT9LT1lLSU8s40Qci8sxOAWv//BwA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">74 bytes</a> to represent <code>-4</code>, or 18.5 bytes per <code>-1</code> (up from the baseline 7 bytes). And we need <em>a lot</em> of <code>-1</code>s. 117704 of them to be precise.</p>

<p>Proof of irreducibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>No entire rows can be removed, the <code>1?</code> lines appear to be, but due to the duplicated <code>"</code> (one above, one below), this will result in the string <code>*n͐</code> being multiplied against the next value on the stack, which (as the string is first) is not a valid action. the <code>n..."</code> row can't be removed along with those two, as the <code>n</code> is needed in the leftmost column</li>
<li>There is no 8-way contiguous vertical collection of <code>.</code> that can be removed (reducing pattern width), as the lower right corner is inaccessible and no other <code>.</code> exist on the bottom row.</li>
<li>Directional change characters can't be removed without bypassing the needed number of <code>-1</code> operations. The closest we can get is changing the bottom row to <code>"*"n+..</code>, but this would only be viable if the initial value <code>"rb"n</code> (9141) minus the desired character was both:

<ol>
<li>Divisible by 4</li>
<li>Constructable from the available bytes (<code>e</code>: <code>2260</code>/<code>"inch"</code>, <code>!</code>: <code>2277</code>/<code>"failure"</code>, the rest are not divisible by 4)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>Or</em> if "rb" can be reduced to either "r" or "b" without adversely affecting the output (note that <code>"r "</code> and <code>" b"</code> are not valid and will produce a <code>-1</code> instead of a positive value). Given a vertical arrangement of the setup and output sequences and the ability to place these bytes such that this is prevented, this will not be possible.

<ul>
<li>Six rows need to be prevented from wholesale deletion (partial deletion results in <code>"r."</code> or <code>".b"</code> where <code>.</code> is a non-empty byte)</li>
<li>Putting <code>rb</code> and <code>k$</code> on paired rows</li>
<li>entry and terminator each on their own rows</li>
<li>A reflector on the top row above a <code>^</code> entry point protects the top row</li>
<li>Any row with the <code>"</code> around <code>rb</code> is automatically protected, as these bytes need to remain</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the entry column is <code>_^"rb"n͐</code>, the output/reset between letters is two columns, <code>̌.."rb"!͐</code> / <code>᷾..$k..̂.</code>, and the last column (aligning <code>k$</code> with the initial <code>rb</code>) is <code>..;$k.̂.</code> (executed bottom to top).</p>

<p>The two columns allow the code to bloat slightly, adding seven more <code>.</code> positions over keeping input and reset on a single column (<code>k$"rb"ǹ</code>) as well as an additional (more expensive) <code>᷾</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://tio.run/##KyrNy0z@/z9e6UyPlpL2w@37gAxtPT0gQ@9MD4hSAAM9rjg9INACEXowIaU8IEcJjEF8BQVrriKQvCEQF6lAhFS4kkBC9kCclA0RyuZS0js7QU9bT0lLKe9MkxLcvLyzEyBCQIa2nqIiUNGZJqBMIlDyTNP//wA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> represents code entry, one copy of the pattern, one output, and final output (a newline) and termination. Not the extra <code>!</code> needed on the last iteration of the pattern so that flow is correctly handled (this costs a measly 13*3 bytes; along with 7*4 bytes at the end of rows that we can't enforce not being removed).</p>

<p>Finally, replace all <code>.</code> and <code>*</code> with <code>􀀀</code> (or other four-byte codepoint).</p>

<p><sub>I've done my best to accurately account for the overhead increases and costs after computing the raw pattern's byte sum, but I recognize I may be off by a small amount.</sub></p>

<h3>Ohgodwhy; it gets bigger</h3>

<p>I <em>believe</em> this is irreducible.</p>

Sequence <code>&gt;.0</code> simply to set the stack to contain an initial value (and should be considered <code>...</code>)</p>

<p>All the <code>UDLR/\</code> would be replaced by their 2-byte modifier counterparts and every cell not otherwise filled with a command is given a 4-byte unicode character. This works out to (I think) 647 bytes to generate a single -1. On top of that, our initial value rises from <code>"rb"n</code> (9141) to 914,100,000 by making each initial letter get constructed from <code>"rb"nYC</code>. As <code>YC</code> occupy space, they would irreparably damage the redirection pattern.</p>

<p><em>Roughly</em> speaking (accurate overhead between letters not verified, but we're talking about a few dozen bytes at most), this works out to a <strong>score of 7,688,494,370,086 (7.6 trillion).</strong></p>

<p>Breaking this would require finding a way to bypass the maze of pointer redirections without (a) breaking the pattern--as a large number of the paths redirect away an infinite loop or an invalid command--and still (b) generating a 5 character long string prior to hitting the <code>n</code>, due to a <code>:l͍5≠?</code> jump check. It costs a few bytes to make this check (11 bytes lost), but reinforces the durability of the pattern.</p>

<p>The string <code>pathz</code> was chosen as a 5-character long sequence where every right-truncated string ("p", "pa", "pat", "path") was present in the word dictionary (meaning that when calling <code>n</code> on it, a positive value will be generated), forcing the program to trace out a meandering route to pick up each letter before hitting the <code>"z"</code> to get a string <em>not</em> in the dictionary. This can still be improved as <code>paths</code> is also present in the dictionary (leading to a 6-length string <code>pathsz</code>), but at this point I'm starting to look for something that will increase the byte count exponentially and searching the word dictionary for longer strings with the desired characteristics is tedious.</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>

<pre><code>"...",`                  Count 0's and convert to string
       3/{   }%          Map over each group of 3 digits:

<p>The ascii codepoints for "Hello, World!" are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>072 101 108 108 111 044 032 087 111 114 108 100 033
</code></pre>

<p>Concatenating them together isn't enough to be able to access them by splitting them into threes because the integer would be interpreted as 72101... rather than 072101..., meaning that splitting it into threes would yield 721 as the first codepoint instead of 072. To remedy this, I doubled it and then divided each individual codepoint by 2 after they're separated out. This has the added bonus of nearly doubling the length of the code.</p>

<p><code>⎕UCS(13⌿ .. )⊤≢⍬⍬⍬...</code> part is classic. Without going through <code>⎕RL</code>, the highest single number you can get is <code>*⌿2+⍪⍨1</code>, which is <code>3*3</code> or 27. The only other system function that can be made from <code>⎕RL</code> is <code>⎕R</code>, which doesn't work with numbers (it's PCRE replace function).</p>

<p><code>13⌿*⌿9⌿9</code> does this: make 9 copies of 9, reduce it by power (RTL), and again make 13 copies of it. Since we need 13 digits (to convert to 13-character string), we can't touch <code>13⌿</code>. The only operator that contributes to making a number higher than 114 is <code>*</code> (power), so we can't remove it either. If any char is removed from <code>9⌿9</code>, we simply get a 9 or 99. If <code>⌿</code> of <code>*⌿</code> is removed, the <code>*</code> becomes "power of e" instead, so <code>⎕UCS</code> will error out.</p>

<p>The trailing section contains exactly <strong>389960998265612367812323333</strong> zilde <code>⍬</code> symbols. There's no whitespace.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p><code>⎕UCS</code> converts from Unicode codepoints to characters. You don't get any string without it.</p>

<p><code>⊤</code> does the only numerical calculation in this program. What it does is, take a single number on its right and convert into the base on its left. Since we want an array of length 13, length-13 array is required on its left side. Since the largest digit value we will need is 114, I chose base 115 to tightly fit the requirements of left side of <code>⊤</code>.</p>

<p>The right side of <code>⊤</code> is <code>≢⍬⍬⍬⍬⍬⍬...</code>, which computes the length <code>≢</code> of the array containing exactly 389960998265612367812323333 <code>⍬</code>s. <code>⍬</code> is an empty numeric vector, so you can't get any meaningful number from it, other than the length of the vector.</p>

<p>Finally, a comment about the byte count. In <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a> challenges, we use SBCS to count the APL symbols as one byte each. But the default source encoding is actually UTF-8, making APL symbols take 2 or 3 bytes.</p>

However, <code>´</code> is the quote character in Charcoal, so it needs to be doubled in order to quote itself, thus requiring 144202216216222088064174222228216200066 <code>´</code>s. The length is then converted to base 1000 using the predefined variable that contains 1000, and the values are then converted to their Unicode character values. However, the result is still an array, so the <code>↑</code> is used to output the characters correctly.</p>

<p>Proof of validity:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>B</code> is the only operator in the source that can return a string, thus it cannot be removed.</li>
<li><code>B</code> on an empty stack returns an empty string, and on a single-element stack it returns <code>10</code>. So we absolutely need two elements on the stack. Since <code>0</code> and <code>₃</code> are the only operators in the source that increase the size of the stack, neither can be removed.</li>
<li>If <code>!</code> was removed, the resulting program would look like <code>0 (some number of '&gt;'s) ₃B</code>. This converts the number of <code>&gt;</code>s to base 95. Since <code>!</code> is not a base-95 digit in 05AB1E, this cannot produce the string <code>Hello, World!</code>. Thus <code>!</code> cannot be removed.</li>
<li>Since neither <code>0</code>, <code>₃</code>, <code>!</code>, nor <code>B</code> can be removed, the program is guaranteed to look like <code>0 (some number of '&gt;'s) ₃!B</code>. This converts the number of <code>&gt;</code>s to base 95! (where <code>!</code> means factorial). This is an injective operation: only one number will yield <code>Hello, World!</code> when converted to base 95!. Thus, the number of <code>&gt;</code>s cannot be altered.</li>

<p>This can certainly be longer, but I'm going to post it now since I'm not 100% sure this is irreducible. It is basically made up of several irreducible components stacked together.</p>

<p>This relies mostly on a very large number <code>n</code>, generated by the state of the Mersenne twister with the seed <code>8</code> reduced by <s>multiplication</s> exponentation, i.e <code>~functools.reduce(pow,b)</code>, where <code>b</code> is taken from:</p>

<pre><code>import functools
from random import *
seed(8)
d=getstate()
a,b,c=d
</code></pre>

<p>First, it execs the reverse of a very long string, separated by n waste bytes in the form:</p>

<pre><code>exec("a...b...c...d"[::~n])
</code></pre>

<p>You can't remove the <code>.</code>s, unless you also remove the <code>[::~n]</code> reversing the string. If you remove the <code>.</code>s and the <code>[::~n]</code> then the resulting program won't really work since it is backwards, and the only <code>print</code> part is at the end, so no output without that.</p>

<p>The next portion looks like:</p>

<pre><code>print(''.join([chr(len(...)), n ''s, chr(len(...)))][::~n]))
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, you can't remove the <code>''</code>s without also taking out the <code>[::~n]</code>. You also can't reduce <code>chr(len([0]+[0]+...+[0]))</code> and still get the character you want, nor can I find anyway of modifying it with the <code>''</code>s to still get the character as well as another list item.</p>

<p>Please point any mistakes I have made or any ways you can think of to reduce this.</p>

<p>Where <code>[...]</code> is <span class="math-container">\$2^{52}-14\$</span> <code>?</code> characters.</p>
<p>The -1 is needed since strings cannot be longer than <span class="math-container">\$2^{52}-1\$</span> characters.</p>
<p><code>a</code> cannot be reduced to a smaller number other than <code>1</code>,

<p>The <code>console.log</code> cannot be reduced,
since none of the characters are needed in the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot;.</p>

<p>This was made using <a href="http://www.jsfuck.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jsfuck.com</a> with the input <code>console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)</code>. This is the smallest program I could make. Smallest because, due to the fact that there's only 6 characters, I'm afraid that a bigger one could easily remove characters to come up with a smaller one.</p>
