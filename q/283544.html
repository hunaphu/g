<p>This solution is taken from Martin Davis's article <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2318447?seq=10" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Hilbert's Tenth Problem Is Unsolvable</em></a>, using the sets of equations in theorems 3.1 and 3.5. The proof for why this works is approximately fifteen pages, so I won't be replicating it here - Matiyasevič’s theorem, which draws an equivalence between solutions to Diophantine equations and the values of sets that can be enumerated by a program, and is the reason this challenge is solvable, relies on the exponential function <em>being</em> Diophantine, which took multiple decades to prove.</p>
<p>I've replaced the base <span class="math-container">\$n\$</span> in the given equations with <span class="math-container">\$2\$</span>, and reformatted the equations to be polynomials that fit the challenge's spec. The scoring system is a bit weird - in particular, there's no way to subtract two formulas directly, and the scoring around them is weird - e.g. <code>a - b</code> previously had to be scored as <code>(a) - b^1</code>, or <code>a + b(-1)</code>, although this has now been changed. I think I've done a reasonably good job, but it's possible there's more to be saved.</p>
