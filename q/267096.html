<p>A full program taking three arguments. The first argument is a list of two lists of integers. This will be base digits for the numerator and denominator if converting to the factoradic representation. If converting from factoradic representation, it will be the factoradic digits before and after the point. The second argument will be an integer representing the base and the third will be the integer <code>3</code> for conversion to factoradic representation and <code>4</code> for conversion from factoradic representation. The program prints a list of lists of integers representing the results of the conversion. When converting from factoradic, the result will always be a fraction in its simplest form, with a denominator of 1 for integers. When converting to factoradic, a zero whole number portion is represented as an empty list, while after the point there will always be the two fixed zeros (even if there are no other digits).</p>
<p>The TIO link runs a series of five variants of the test cases from the question, first converting to factoradic and then back again.</p>
<p>Integer maths is used throughout, so should handle any size of input.</p>
