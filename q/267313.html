<p>FINALLY! After 8 months of working on this, the creation of not one, but <em>two</em> programming languages to abstract over Chef, and the help of many many people over in The Nineteenth Byte, I have done this. I have solved the challenge... in Chef. This will inevitably get shorter as I improve the compiler optimizations.</p>
<h2>Forget the explanation, how do I run this?</h2>
<p>The official Chef spec is underspecified. Therefore, I have taken the liberty of assuming three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The interpreter is capable of handling negative numbers.</li>
<li>The interpeter is capable of handling decimal numbers (implied but not stated outright in the spec).</li>
<li>The <code>Stir</code> instruction does not go past the bottom of the bowl.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, with those constraints in place, the only online interpreter I found that follows them is the <a href="https://esolangpark.vercel.app/ide/chef" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Esolang Park</a> interpreter. To run the code, simply copy-paste it into the input box. I do suggest setting the delay from 20ms to 0ms, and even then it will take a bit for the code to run.</p>
<p>As for input, Chef does not have any way of inputting strings. Threfore, the input format is as follows: the integer value of each code point, with the string terminated by a <code>0</code>. <a href="https://vyxal.github.io/latest.html#H4sIAAAAAAAAAzXJMQ6CQBAF0Kusv7CaEAhWcwFLG7vNFhuYBRLdIcOChSHxJB7OkxgLu5e8J5LaPRZwSxgl9mJggNBpL2Bc6uPn9QYhqZb_pVscFrAPhCnPa_nZ42y6zq4BeVxHEyFXHkpOs5Ab9IAQAmETWybNYLTVqWpq7F9p8pMTggAAAA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is a quick Vyxal program to automatically do it for you.</p>
<h2>Just get to the point already, how does it work?</h2>
<p>Ok ok, I'll get to the point. Remember when I said I created two new languages? Well Chef is a language that is... not exactly well suited for string manipulation. I learned that the hard way, pretty quickly. So I thought, why not make a quick &quot;psuedo assembly language&quot; to compile too it? Surely it cannot be <em>that</em> hard.</p>
<p>That was March 18th of this year. 8 months ago.</p>
<h4>Recipe</h4>
<p>So I began coding. And coding. And coding. Soon I had a workable &quot;assembly language&quot;. It looked something like this (this is a <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Truth-machine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">truth machine</a>):</p>
<pre><code>def $input;
read $input;
while $input {
    print 1;
    flush;
};
print 0;
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;With the addition of macros,&quot; I thought, &quot;this will be able to solve the challenge.&quot;</p>
<p>Nuh uh.</p>
<p>I soon realized that while this language made Chef a lot more bearable to deal with, it <em>still</em> wasn't capable of doing this.</p>
<p>But I was resolved to get that 200 rep bounty.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/commit/29c4216dbbd502ded62ced0ea5d424c5e4dfaa57" rel="nofollow noreferrer">on May 27th</a>, I officially named the assembly language &quot;Recipe&quot; and began work on a newer, better language that I called &quot;Gourmet&quot;.</p>
<h4>Gourmet</h4>
<p>Gourmet is a language I made with the explicit aim of being like C. That is, higher-level concepts, compiling down onto a stack machine (which is essentially what Chef is). To make it simpler, I reused my older work on Recipe, and made Gourmet compile down into Recipe first, which then gets compiled into Chef. Over the months, I worked on Gourmet, and it actually turned out to be a pretty nice language. It has monomorphized generics, inlining, all your standard C control flow and operations (except modulo, I still haven't figured out how to implement that in a language with no distinction between intergers and floats. Also no <code>goto</code>.), comments, pointers (heap only), structs, a proper <code>Unit</code> type, and a few compiler optimizations even. About the only C feature it doesn't have is unions (and also function pointers, but that'd be trivial to add, I just don't need of them). As a code sample, have a fibonacci:</p>
<pre><code>fun fib(n: Number): Number {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
}

@entry
fun main() {
    print(fib(read()));
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/master/gourmet/src/main/resources/std.gourmet" rel="nofollow noreferrer">more examples</a></p>
<p>Our sister site <a href="https://langdev.stackexchange.com/">PLDI</a> helped out a lot, particularly the question <a href="https://langdev.stackexchange.com/q/1064/45">How to transpile goto to a language that lacks it?</a>. Based on that question, Gourmet uses a giant state machine to implement control flow.</p>
<p>Probably the most interesting proablem I had to solve is pointers and the heap. In Gourmet, pointers are heap-only, as the &quot;stack&quot; is simply stored as Chef ingredients. There's just one tiny problem: Chef is a stack based language. While this makes compiling easier, it also means that there is no way to randomly access something in a stack. So to implement the heap, I did the following: the heap is a Chef stack (or &quot;bowl&quot;, as Chef calls them), containing the heap data. Pointers point into this heap, starting at index 0 being the bottom. There is also an &quot;anti heap&quot;. When dereferencing a pointer, all values after the requested one are popped off the heap one by one and pushed onto the anti heap. Then the value is get/set, and the reverse happens. If you pay careful attention as the Chef program runs, you will see bowls 7 (the heap) and 8 (the anti heap) juggle values as pointers are en- and de-referenced.</p>
<h2>Finally, the program itself</h2>
<p>After that bit of detour, let's finally get to the program itself. All relevant files can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/can-the-chefs-go-in-chef" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> repository.</p>
<pre><code>fun readInputLower(): String {
    let arr = newArray[Number](0);

</code></pre>
<p>Ok. Let us take apart the first function.</p>
<pre><code>fun readInputLower(): String {
    let arr = newArray[Number](0);
    while (true) {
        let input = read();
        if (!transmute[Number, Boolean](input)) {

        }
        if (input &gt; 64 &amp;&amp; input &lt; 91) {

        }
        asm[Nothing](&quot;&quot;&quot;
            @heap.push [input];
            inc $heapSize;
        &quot;&quot;&quot;);
        arr.len += 1;
    }
    return transmute[Array[Number], String](arr);
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>readInputLower</code> does exactly what it says: it reads the program's input as lowercase.</p>
<pre><code>let arr = newArray[Number](0);
</code></pre>
<p>This calls <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/resources/std.gourmet#L72" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a function in the stdlib</a> that creates a new <code>Array[Number]</code> with size 0. <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/resources/std.gourmet#L57" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Array[T]</code></a> is a <code>struct</code> with two components: a <code>T</code> pointer <code>data</code>, and a <code>Number</code> <code>len</code>.</p>
<pre><code>while (true) {

</code></pre>
<p>We now start looping for the input. <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/resources/std.gourmet#L18" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>read</code></a> is a stdlib function that simply reads a number from the Chef input.</p>

}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Now</em> we're getting to the interesting stuff. <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/kotlin/io/github/seggan/gourmet/compilation/CompiletimeFunction.kt#L47" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>transmute</code></a> is a builtin function that performs a &quot;bit cast&quot;. That is, it <em>reinterprets the bytes</em> of the input as the given output type. In this case, the <code>Number</code> input is getting converted to a <code>Boolean</code> and NOT-ed. If you're wondering why I'm not simply doing <code>input == 0</code>, it's simple. This produces less code.</p>
<pre><code>if (input &gt; 64 &amp;&amp; input &lt; 91) {
    input += 32;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is an age-old trick to make a number lowercase. Nothing special.</p>
<pre><code>asm[Nothing](&quot;&quot;&quot;
    @heap.push [input];
    inc $heapSize;
&quot;&quot;&quot;);
arr.len += 1;
</code></pre>
<p>More cursed code! Yay!</p>
<p>Now while I <em>could</em> theoretically deallocate and reallocate the string/array every time I want to append, this is <em>code golf</em>, and code golf never wastes bytes. Since we know newly allocated objects are always at the end of the heap, we simply... append to the heap! And increment the size, of course. Don't want any memory leaks. <sub>We ignore the fact that Gourmet has no <code>free</code> function.</sub> Now <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/kotlin/io/github/seggan/gourmet/compilation/CompiletimeFunction.kt#L21" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>asm</code></a> is another one of those builtin functions, and it takes in a Recipe string and a type parameter that tells the compiler what <code>asm</code> returns. In this case, <code>Nothing</code>. Literally. It has a size of 0. Now the Recipe code in there is not inserted verbatim. In order to prevent issues, Gourmet variables are mangled. The <code>[input]</code> code in the <code>asm</code> tells the compiler to replace the <code>[input]</code> with the mangled form of <code>input</code>.</p>
<pre><code>}
return transmute[Array[Number], String](arr);
</code></pre>
<p>We transmute again! This time, from an <code>Array[Number]</code> to a <code>String</code>. <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/kotlin/io/github/seggan/gourmet/typing/Type.kt#L123" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>String</code></a> is a builtin <code>struct</code> that has the same layout as <code>Array</code>: a <code>Char</code> pointer <code>data</code>, and a <code>Number</code> <code>len</code>. Therefore we can effortlessly transmute between the two.</p>
<pre><code>fun indexOf(s: String, start: Number, other: String): Number {
    let i = start;
    while (i &lt; s.len) {
        let j = 0;
        while (j &lt; other.len) {
            if (get(s, i + j) != get(other, j)) {
                break;
            }
            j += 1;
        }
        if (j == other.len) {
            return i;
        }
        i += 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>There's not really much to explain here, it's just your standard &quot;find substring past this index&quot; function.</p>
<pre><code>@entry
fun main() {
    let input = readInputLower();
    let startIndex = 0;
    let three = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;three&quot;);
    if (three == -1) {
        return;
    }
    startIndex = three + 5;
    let two = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;two&quot;);
    if (two == -1) {
        return;
    }
    startIndex = two + 3;
    let one = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;one&quot;);
    if (one == -1) {
        return;
    }
    startIndex = one + 3;
    let go = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;go&quot;);
    if (go == -1) {
        return;
    }
    print(go + 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now the good stuff! <code>@entry</code> is an <em>attribute</em> that specifies &quot;hey compiler, listen up. This is where you start executing.&quot; There is also <code>@inline</code>, which tells the compiler to inline the function at all call sites. <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/resources/std.gourmet#L2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code></a> is a good example of the latter.</p>
<pre><code>let input = readInputLower();
let startIndex = 0;
let three = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;three&quot;);
if (three == -1) {
    return;
}
startIndex = three + 5;
</code></pre>
<p>So we read the input string (as lowercase of course), and then we start searching from the start for &quot;three&quot;. If the index is <code>-1</code>, we know it's not found, and we just return. Otherwise, we set the start index to the index of &quot;three&quot; plus the length of &quot;three&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>let two = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;two&quot;);
if (two == -1) {
    return;
}
startIndex = two + 3;
let one = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;one&quot;);
if (one == -1) {
    return;
}
startIndex = one + 3;
let go = indexOf(input, startIndex, &quot;go&quot;);
if (go == -1) {
    return;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we do the same with &quot;two&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;go&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>print(go + 1);
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we <a href="https://github.com/Seggan/gourmet/blob/b9575dd99605355cf1ea8414e124ca5a8e8b5b38/gourmet/src/main/resources/std.gourmet#L10" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code></a> the index of &quot;go&quot; plus one, which is the index of &quot;o&quot;.</p>

IF&quot;&quot;=w$THEN?i-2:END
IF i&lt;LEN(s$)GOTO 1
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Lacking regex or any string find/split options, we loop through the input one character at a time (mostly) and check for the desired strings.</p>
<pre><code>LINE INPUT s$
w$ = &quot;three&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Read a line of input and store it in <code>s$</code>. Initialize <code>w$</code> (the current word we're looking for) to <code>three</code>.</p>
<pre><code>DATA two,one,go,
</code></pre>
<p>Set the remaining words as DATA that can be read later (plus a trailing empty string after the final comma).</p>
<pre><code>1 i = i + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Define label 1 (top of the loop). Increment <code>i</code> (the current character index, one-based).</p>
<pre><code>IF LCASE$(MID$(s$, i, LEN(w$))) = w$ THEN
  READ w$
  i = i + 2
END IF
</code></pre>
<p>Take a substring of <code>s$</code>, starting at index <code>i</code>, the same length as <code>w$</code>. Lowercase it. If that equals <code>w$</code>, then read the next word into <code>w$</code> and skip forward two characters (to avoid incorrectly matching <code>twone</code>).</p>
<pre><code>IF w$ = &quot;&quot; THEN
  PRINT i - 2
  END
END IF
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>w$</code> is now the empty string, we've matched all four words. The current value of <code>i</code> is two more than the one-based index of <code>go</code>, which is also two more than the zero-based index of the <code>o</code> in <code>go</code>. So we subtract two, print it, and end the program.</p>
<pre><code>IF i &lt; LEN(s$) THEN GOTO 1
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, if <code>i</code> hasn't walked off the end of the string yet, goto the top of the loop. If we've looped through the whole string without finding all four words in order, the program ends without printing anything.</p>

<p>The regex is pretty straightforward, all the magic comes from the configuration flags at the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>I</code>: find the position of the matches</li>
<li><code>^</code>: use the position of the last character instead of the first</li>
<li><code>i</code>: case insensitive</li>
<li><code>w</code>: do this for all possible ways (even overlapping) of matching this regex</li>
<li><code>0</code>: return only the first one</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, <code>w0</code> will make sure that we return the earliest possible complete match, and is shorter than any other option based on lazy matching (<code>.*?</code>)</p>

<p><code>regexpr(&quot;three.*two.*one.*g\\Ko&quot;,scan(,&quot;&quot;),,T)[1]-1</code></p>
<p>Thanks to Bbrk24 for pointing out that <code>\K</code> (you have to use an extra backslash in R) sets where the match is considered to start.</p>
<p>R has a lot of built in regex functions, and this one handily tells you where the first match starts (-1 if there is no match). It's 1-indexed though, so we have to take 1 off (and hence, if the chefs can't go, -2 is returned, but that's less than 11 so we're good).</p>
<p>We need to specify <code>perl=TRUE</code> to use the <code>\K</code> feature. It's cheapest to specify that positionally rather than use <code>pe=T</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/3Hjcx.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/3Hjcx.png" alt="two example cases where the code returns 25 for a string where the cooks can go, and -2 for a case where they can't go at all" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on conventions for how the input is available, the <code>scan(,&quot;&quot;)</code> could turn into a variable (e.g. <code>x</code>) or function (<code>\(x)</code>) saving 8 or 4 bytes respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu22" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://www.perl.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Perl 5</a> + <code>-p</code>, 34 bytes</h1>
