<div id="pu0" class="pu"><h1>Binary Lambda Calculus (BLC)</h1>
<p>BLC was developed to make Algorithmic Information Theory, the theory of smallest programs, more concrete. It starts with the simplest model of computation, the lambda calculus, and adds the minimum amount of machinery to enable binary input and output.</p>
<p>More specifically, it defines a universal machine, which, from an input stream of bits, parses the binary encoding of a lambda calculus term, applies that to the remainder of input (translated to a lazy list of booleans, which have a standard representation in lambda calculus), and translates the evaluated result back into a stream of bits to be output.</p>
<p>Lambda is encoded as 00, application as 01, and the variable bound by the n'th enclosing lambda (denoted n in so-called De Bruijn notation) as 1^{n}0. That’s all there is to BLC!</p>
<p>For example the encoding of lambda term S = \x \y \z (x z) (y z), with De Bruijn notation \ \ \ (3 1) (2 1), is 00 00 00 01 01 1110 10 01 110 10</p>
<p>In the closely related BLC8 language, IO is byte oriented, translating between a stream of bytes and a list of length-8 lists of booleans.</p>

<p>I apologize for the low efforts.</p>
<p>YASEPL is an esoteric programming language (written in Node.js) that is inspired on the likes of Brainf*** and Vyxal, featuring commands that are one symbol and half aren't on a standard US keyboard. Syntax is based on something I like to call the &quot;MYOL&quot; syntax, because the language itself is based on a template (that is based on another esoteric language I made) that I made ~2-3 years ago.</p>
<p>I have yet to write a proper documentation for this language (mostly due to laziness) so I guess this can count as it for now.</p>
<p><strong>factoid</strong>: YASEPL can somewhat be easily translated from some types of BASIC due to it using somewhat the same principles.</p>

<pre><code>=i    - declare I (as 0)
`1    - marker 1

<div id="pu2" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rust</a></h1>
<p>Rust is a general purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Mozilla Research. It is designed to be &quot;safe, concurrent, and fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Since Rust emphasizes stability, these snippets shouldn't be subject to change anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Length 68</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>fn a&lt;T:Default&gt;(v:T,p:&amp;dyn Display)-&gt;T{println!(&quot;{p}&quot;);T::default()}
</code></pre>
<p>For any Type <code>T</code> that implements the <code>Default</code> trait and that calls function <code>a</code> in your code, the compiler will create a dedicated function that only that type will call and use. This is called monomorphization.</p>
<p>At the same time, all these new functions accept a value <code>p</code>, as a fat pointer (A pointer to the value, and the display implementation of that value).</p>
<p>These new functions can display the value <code>p</code> by <em>dynamic dispatch</em> (invoked by <code>&amp;dyn Display</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Length 19</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>|x|print!(&quot;{}&quot;,x*2)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a closure, similar to a lambda or anonymous function in other languages. It takes one argument <code>x</code> and prints its doubled value.
Note that the type for <code>x</code> was not specified. It will be inferred by the compiler automatically when this closure is called.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>enum X{A(u8),B}
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of an enum, the other one of the two primary types of custom data structures. Enums can be one of a list of variants (here <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>) and can also carry data (here <code>u8</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Length 14</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>struct X{a:u8}
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>struct</code> is one of the two primary ways of defining a custom type. It consists of a group of typed fields, which must all be initialized to construct a value.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>&amp;mut String
</code></pre>
<p>This is the syntax for declaring a mutable reference, a key principle for memory and data management in Rust. It is enforced at compile time that at all times a value may either have only one mutable reference to it or arbitrarily many immutable references (written <code>&amp;String</code>). This makes some code designs less easy to accomplish, but helps a lot to avoid bugs.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>Option&lt;u8&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Rust doesn't have a <code>null</code> value like many other languages do. Instead, you use the <code>Option</code> <code>enum</code> (see snippet 15), which is either <code>Some</code> and contains a value, or <code>None</code> and empty.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>fn main()
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>main()</code> function is, well, the main function where the program begins. Here's the example of hello world (also automatically generated by <code>cargo new</code> as a template):</p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>fn main() { println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;); }
</code></pre>
<p>If saved as <code>hello.rs</code>, the source can be compiled and run using this command:</p>
<pre><code>rustc hello.rs &amp;&amp; ./hello
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>
<pre><code>fn x(){}
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example on how to create a function named <code>x</code>. The arguments can be written inside <code>()</code>, the statements or expressions can be written inside <code>{}</code>, and the return type can be given with a <code>-&gt;</code> after the arguments, for example:</p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>fn x(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    if a == 0 { return b; }
    a + b // equal to return a+b;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>return</code> keyword is used to exit the function. Just like Ruby, the last expression at the end of the program will be returned when it is reached. Here's the exact same function without the <code>return</code> keyword:</p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>fn x(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    if a == 0 { b } else { a + b }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By default, all functions return <code>()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>
<pre><code>if x {}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the <code>if</code> syntax of rust, this part is similar to <code>Go</code>'s <code>if</code> syntax. We could also write it like this:</p>
<pre><code>let y = if z == 3 { 9 } else if z &gt; 3 { 12 } else { 15 };
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>print!
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>print!</code> and <code>println!</code> macros are the standard ways to produce output. They have a similar syntax to <code>.NET</code>'s <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.format%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">String.Format</a> method. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>print!(&quot;{0} {1} {0}&quot;,123,234);     // 123 234 123
println!(&quot;{} {} {}&quot;,123,234,345);  // 123 234 345
print!(&quot;{a} {b} {c}&quot;,a=1,c=2,b=3); // 1 3 2
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>{}</code> symbols are called <code>next argument</code> specifier, <code>{number}</code> is a positional parameter, and <code>{string}</code> is a named parameter, we could mix any of them. To print the type of a value, you can use <code>:?</code> debug traits, see this <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#formatting-traits" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> for more formatting traits.</p>
<pre><code>println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, 123 );
// 123i32

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, &quot;abc&quot; );
// &quot;abc&quot;

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, std::io::stdin().read_line() );
// some possible outcomes:
//  Ok(&quot;string that has been read\n&quot;)
//  Err(IoError { kind: EndOfFile, desc: &quot;end of file&quot;, detail: None })

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, std::io::stdin().read_line().ok() );
// some possible outcomes:
//  Some(&quot;string that has been read\n&quot;)
//  None

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, std::io::stdin().read_line().ok().expect(&quot;Fatal: read_line failed!&quot;) );
// some possible outcomes:
//  &quot;string that has been read\n&quot;
//  thread '&lt;main&gt;' panicked at 'Fatal: read_line failed!'
//  {traceback elided}
//  ^ this one not entering the println! function
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>print!</code> is called with an <code>!</code> at the end: this is because it is a macro instead of a function. Macros expand to regular Rust code during compilation and are a powerful tool for writing more flexible code.
Here, this is utilized to check the format arguments at compile-time and to allow a variable number of arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>
<pre><code>stdin
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>stdin</code> is a function that could access the standard input (when called, it returns a <code>std::io::stdio::StdinReader</code> type), usage example:</p>
<pre><code>let s = std::io::stdin().read_line().ok().expect(&quot;Fatal: read_line failed!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Or we may type:</p>
<pre><code>use std::io::stdin; // outside function
let s = stdin().read_line().ok()
               .expect(&quot;Fatal: read_line failed!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>.ok()</code> part would check if <code>read_line</code> failed and the <code>.expect(&quot;Fatal: read_line failed!&quot;)</code> part would exit the program when it does.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>true
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in other common programming languages, this is a value of type <code>bool</code>. As you can guess, the other value is named <code>false</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>let
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>let</code> keyword is primarily used as to declare a variable; here's an example on how to use it:</p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>let x = 1;
let (y, z) = (3, 4);
let a: u64 = 18446744073709551610;
</code></pre>
<p>The variables defined by the <code>let</code> keyword are immutable. To make them mutable, add the <code>mut</code> keyword, for example:</p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>let mut b = 123;
b = 234;   
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of how to create an empty string slice (called <code>&amp;str</code>). This string is saved in the program's binary, and cannot be mutated or deleted at runtime. There is another type of string in Rust, a mutable one, that is called <code>String</code>. To convert between <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>String</code> use the <code>.to_string()</code> method, that copies the old string into another place so it can be modified (mutated). To convert a <code>String</code> to <code>&amp;str</code>, use <code>.as_slice()</code> method.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-rust prettyprint-override"><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>This an example of a valid number literal which will be of the type <code>i32</code> by default. To force it to be of another type, use that type as a suffix such as <code>u8</code>, <code>i8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>i16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>i32</code>, <code>u64</code>, <code>i64</code>, <code>usize</code>, <code>isize</code>, <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>.</p>

<div id="pu3" class="pu"><h1>GNU Sed</h1>
<p>I am self-imposing a more restrictive requirement - all snippets will be complete <code>sed</code> programs.</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p><code>sed</code> <em>is</em> a Turing-complete language. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150217125442/http://robertkotcher.com/sed.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is a proof.</a></p>
<h3>Length 0 Snippet</h3>
<p>I don't think a length 0 snippet is strictly required, but since it actually does something in sed, here it is:</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Sed is the &quot;Stream EDitor&quot;, i.e. it reads the stream (line-by-line) from STDIN, edits, then outputs to STDOUT. The zero-length sed program simply copies STDIN to STDOUT. Thus the <code>cat</code> utility may be emulated by sed. The following are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>cat a.txt b.txt &gt; c.txt
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>sed '' a.txt b.txt &gt; c.txt
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>=
</code></pre>
<p>This sed program prints the line number of each line to STDOUT. This is approximately equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>nl
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>cat -n
</code></pre>
<p>although the sed version puts the line number on its own line.</p>
<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>5q
</code></pre>
<p>Copies STDIN to STOUT and <code>q</code>uits after line 5. This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>head -n5
</code></pre>
<p>You might be starting to see a bit of a pattern here - <code>sed</code> can be used to emulate many of the standard coreutils tools.</p>
<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>iHi
</code></pre>
<p><code>i</code>nserts &quot;Hi\n&quot; before every line. Meh.</p>
<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>/a/d
</code></pre>
<p>A lot of sed's power is in its regex capability. This program causes all lines matching the regex <code>a</code> to be <code>d</code>eleted from the stream. All other lines will still be output to STDOUT. This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>grep -v &quot;a&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>:l;bl
</code></pre>
<p>This is an infinite loop. We all love CPU-hogging infinite loops. Defines a label <code>l</code>, then <code>b</code>ranches (jumps) to it. Ad infinitum.</p>
<h3>Length 6 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>N;/a/d
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>N</code> command is very useful when you want information on lines <code>N</code>ext to what you're looking for; it appends an extra line to the pattern space. This will remove any pair of lines (starting from the first line) that match a regex <code>a</code></p>
<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>s/a/A/g
</code></pre>
<p>By default, sed applies <code>s</code> commands such that it will match just the first occurrence on each line. If you need it to match (and substitute) every occurrence on a line, then the <code>g</code> flag at the end of the <code>s</code> command will do this.</p>
<h3>Length 8 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>y/01/10/
</code></pre>
<p>The little used <code>y</code> command is similar to the <code>tr</code> shell utility (though not quite as flexible). This program will switch all <code>0</code>s with <code>1</code>s and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Length 9 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1!G;$p;h
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet is 8 bytes, but requires the -n parameter for sed to suppress default output. As per standard code-golf rules, I'm counting this as 9. This uses something called the 'hold space', which is essentailly a place to store something you want later. <code>1!</code> means 'on every line but the first', <code>G</code> appends the hold space to the pattern space, <code>$p</code> means <code>p</code>rint when on the last line, and <code>h</code> replaces the hold space with the current pattern space for us to <code>G</code>rab on the next cycle. So:</p>
<pre><code>sed -n '1!G;$p;h'
</code></pre>
<p>is exactly equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>tac
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 10 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>s/[ &lt;TAB&gt;]+$//
</code></pre>
<p>This is a revisit of the (old) length 6 snippet. This strips trailing whitespace (spaces and TABs) from lines.</p>
<h3>Length 11 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed -n '/a/{N;N;p}'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>{</code> command does exactly what you think it does: it groups a bunch of commands together until there's a <code>}</code>. As with most commands, you can restrict it to a range or a regex; so this program will <code>p</code>rint lines containing regex <code>a</code> along with the two <code>N</code>ext lines following them.</p>
<h3>Length 12 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'1,4d;9,/^$/d'
</code></pre>
<p>Speaking of restricting to ranges or regex, you can even do both at the same time. The first command <code>d</code>eletes lines 1-4 (counting the 1st line as line 1) and the second <code>d</code>eletes line 9, and then continues deleting until (and including) it hits an empty line.</p>
<h3>Length 13 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'/i/,/a/s/a/A/'
</code></pre>
<p>(Read '/i/,/a/' as a range and then 's/a/A/' as the commnad) If you start a range with a regex, sed will start a new range each time you hit that regex. This capitilizes the first <code>a</code> after each line with an i. (it also capitalizes the first a on the same line as an <code>i</code>, if there is one; the second address is not checked until the range starts)</p>
<h3>Length 14 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>:l;N;$!bl;p;p;
</code></pre>
<p>The fisrt bit loads the entire input into the pattern space: define label <code>l</code>, add a line to pattern space, <code>b</code>ranch to <code>l</code> if we're not(<code>!</code>) the last line(<code>$</code>). In total, this program <code>p</code>rints the entire input three times: once for each <code>p</code>, and then again at the end with the default output.</p>
<h3>Length 15 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'/a/,+9d;/i/,~5d'
</code></pre>
<p>GNU Sed adds some interesting ranging options in addition to the earlier ones. <code>,+#</code> will match <code>#</code> lines following the first address and <code>,~#</code> will continue to match until the line number is divisible by <code>#</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 16 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'5,10w output.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>'r insertfile.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>Sed has a way to act directly on files with a command option (<code>-i</code> for edit-<code>i</code>n-place, with an optional backup file using <code>-i.bak</code> or whatever other suffix you want to add) but you can technically read and write to files inside your script. However, be careful when using them; <code>r</code>, for example, will output the entire file at the end of each cycle rather than appending it to the input as you may expect it to. To do this, just give each file name as another command line option like:</p>
<h3>Length 17 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed -s '1F' in.txt file.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-s</code> command lets you treat each added file as an entirely new group of lines, starting the line count over and reseting your ranges. This script, for example, will print the current <code>F</code>ilename whenever it hits the first line of a file, allowing you to see where one file ends and the next begins.</p>
<h3>Length 18 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>'N;H;P;D;P#comments'
</code></pre>
<p>Sed is pretty small in terms of built in commands, so we've almost covered everything. Several commands have a uppercase version which does things one line at a time for when you decide to load more lines into the pattern space with <code>N</code> or append the pattern space to the <code>H</code>old space after a newline: <code>P</code>rint up to first newline, <code>D</code>elete up to the first newline, etc. This is also a good a time as any to mention <code>#</code> makes the rest of the line into a comment, and will not be executed.</p>
<h3>Length 18 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed ':l;N;$!bl;e' srpt.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Coming full circle to rendering other commands in sed, this is roughly the same as <code>sh srpt.sh</code>. The first bit we talked about earlier, loading the full input into the pattern space; and the <code>e</code>xecute command runs the pattern space as a bash script and replaces the pattern space with the resulting output. In this example that means it just prints with the standard end-of-cycle output. You can disable <code>e</code>, as well as <code>r</code> and <code>w</code>, with the <code>--sandbox</code> command line option.</p>
<h3>Length 19 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed '/\\\//,//s///g' --debug
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--debug</code> option is a great help whenever sed does something completely unexpected, as it shows each step sed takes in each cycle. It tells you, for each cycle: where the input is coming from, the new pattern space, the hold space if there is any, each command that is run with the results of that command, and the end of cycle output. It also renders your sed program in a more readable multiline form at the very start.</p>
<p>In this case, what happens is that an empty regex <code>//</code> is replaced with the most recently used regex when an empty regex wouldn't make sense. Since ranges are active whenever they are open, this is the same as just doing <code>'s/\\\///'</code>; ie it <code>s</code>waps each <code>\/</code> with an empty string.a</p>
<h3>Length 20 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>sed -nE 's/(a|b{2})/\u\1/3p'
</code></pre>
<p>The last thing I want to mention is the <code>-E</code> extended regex option, and a few fancy things on the <code>s</code>wap command. <code>-E</code> allows you to use characters for their regex meaning rather than their literal meaning. There are also many 'backslash escapes' you can incorperate into your replace string; used here are <code>\u</code> for 'next letter uppercase' and <code>\1</code> for 'first capture group'. Finally, there are several command which can be supplied as a flag at the end of a <code>s</code>wap statement, like the <code>p</code> which prints if there was a successful swap or <code>3</code> which will only swap the third occurance in the pattern space.</p>

<div id="pu4" class="pu"><h1>APL</h1>
<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>APL (<strong>A</strong> <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>L</strong>anguage) started out as an interpreter for a formula notation devised by <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Iverson" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ken Iverson</a>. When the language was designed, people used teletypwriters to communicate with computers. The character set of these was limited, but due to their construction, one could put multiple characters into the same position to compose complex characters. This feature is heavily used by APL, contributing to its infamous reputation as a read-only language.</p>
<p>You can try out most of the examples on <a href="http://www.tryapl.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.tryapl.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Length 1</h2>
<pre><code>⍝
</code></pre>
<p>The character <code>⍝</code>, called lampshade, both for its shape and for the enlightment you get from its presence, introduces a comment. Historically, it was created by overstriking a <code>∘</code> (jot) and a <code>∩</code> (up shoe).</p>
<h2>Length 2</h2>
<pre><code>⍳3
</code></pre>
<p>The monadic (one argument) function <code>⍳</code> (iota) generates a vector of the first few natural numbers. For instance, the aforementioned <code>⍳3</code> would yield <code>1 2 3</code>, the vector of the first three natural numbers. On some implementations of APL, it would yield <code>0 1 2</code> instead, this depends on the value of <code>⎕IO</code>, the <strong>i</strong>ota <strong>o</strong>rigin.</p>
<h2>Length 3</h2>
<pre><code>5\3
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to the monadic <code>⍳</code>, the dyadic <code>\</code> (expand) function copies the argument on the right as often as the argument on the left; thus, <code>5\3</code> yields <code>3 3 3 3 3</code>. You might want to play around with vector arguments (like <code>1 2 3\4 5 6</code>) to see what it does then.</p>
<h2>Length 4</h2>
<pre><code>A←⍳3
</code></pre>
<p>This assigns to <code>A</code> the value of <code>⍳3</code>. <code>←</code> (left arrow) is the assignment operator. An assignment doesn't have to be the leftmost thing in a statement; assignments are parsed like function calls and yield the assigned value for further use.</p>
<h2>Length 5</h2>
<pre><code>∘.×⍨A
</code></pre>
<p>A three by three multiplication table, that is,</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
</code></pre>
<p>This is a little bit complicated, so let me explain. <code>⍺∘.f⍵</code> (read: alpha jot dot f omega) is the <em>outer product</em> of <code>⍺</code> and <code>⍵</code> over <code>f</code>. The outer product is a table of the result of applying <code>f</code> to each possible pair of elements from <code>⍺</code> and <code>⍵</code>. In this example, <code>f</code> is <code>×</code> (multiply), yielding a multiplication table. The operator <code>⍨</code> (tilde diæresis) <em>commutes</em>  its arguments, that is, <code>⍺f⍨⍵</code> is equal to <code>⍺f⍵</code> and <code>f⍨⍵</code> without a left operand is equal to <code>⍵f⍵</code>. Without the commute operator this snippet would be <code>A∘.×A</code>. The outer product operator is very versatile; check out what happens if you substitute <code>=</code> for <code>×</code>!</p>
<h2>Length 6</h2>
<pre><code>{×/⍳⍵}
</code></pre>
<p>A factorial function. A pair of curly braces encloses a <em>dfn</em> (dynamic function), that is, an anonymous function (cf. lambda expressions). The arguments to a dfn are bound to the variables <code>⍺</code> and <code>⍵</code> or just <code>⍵</code> if the dfn is called as a monadic (single argument, as opposed to dyadic, two argument) function. We apply <code>⍳</code> to the right argument, yielding integers from <code>1</code> to <code>⍵</code>. The <code>/</code> (slash) operator reduces, that is <code>f/⍵</code> inserts <code>f</code> between the items of <code>⍵</code>. For instance, <code>+/⍳5</code> is just <code>1+2+3+4+5</code>. In this case, we reduce with <code>×</code>, yielding the product of the items of <code>⍳⍵</code>, which is just the factorial of <code>⍵</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 7</h2>
<pre><code>2×3*4+5
</code></pre>
<p>Yields <code>39366</code>. <code>⍺*⍵</code> (alpha star omega) is <code>⍺</code> raised to the power of <code>⍵</code>. APL has a very simple precedence rule: Everything is evaluated from right to left, all functions are right-associative. Operators bind stronger than functions and are evaluates from left to right. Thus, the expression above with explicit parentheses would be written as <code>2×(3*(4+5))</code> as opposed to the usual <code>(2×(3*4))+5</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 8</h2>
<pre><code>¯1+3 3⍴A
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet yields</p>
<pre><code>0 1 2
0 1 2
0 1 2
</code></pre>
<p>and demonstrates two important concepts: The first concept is the <code>⍴</code> (rho) function, which <em>reshapes</em> its right argument to the shape specified in its left argument. The shape of an array is a vector of the lengths of each axis in the array. The shape of a scalar is the empty vector. Thus, <code>3 3⍴A</code> reshapes <code>A</code> into a three by three matrix. The second concept is how addition is used here: We add <code>¯1</code> (overbar one), meaning negative one (<code>¯</code> is a prefix to specify negative numbers, while <code>-</code> is an operator) to an array. The two operands have different shapes, so the operand with the lesser shape is distributed onto the other operand, subtracting one from every item in the generated matrix.</p>
<h2>Length 9</h2>
<pre><code>+.×⍨3 3⍴A
</code></pre>
<p><code>A</code>, reshaped to a 3 by 3 matrix, multiplied with itself. The <code>.</code> (dot) operator takes two functions and constructs an <em>inner product</em>, where the first function represents <em>addition</em> and the second function <em>multiplication.</em> A plain, old, matrix multiplication is <code>+.×</code>, a common variant is <code>≠.∧</code> (where <code>≠</code> is not equal and <code>∧</code> (up caret) is logical and) for boolean matrices; many interesting things can be modelled as an inner product with certain operators in place of <code>+</code> and <code>×</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 10</h2>
<pre><code>(.5×⊢+÷)⍣≡
</code></pre>
<p>(read: left parenthesis dot five multiply right-tack plus divide right parenthesis star-diæresis same) Compute the square root of a real using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Babylonian method</a>. The left argument is the number you want to compute the square root of, the right argument is the initial guess for the square root. I originally wanted to provide a meaningful initial guess, but I ran out of characters (append <code>⍨</code> to use the number itself as the initial guess).</p>
<p>So how does this work? Let's start with the left part, <code>(.5×⊢+÷)</code>, first. This expression uses tacit notation originating in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44684/26997">J</a> which was later ported back to Dyalog APL. Tacit notation is a bit hard for beginners, so please read this section carefully. An isolated sequence, such as <code>+/÷≢</code>, which the “normal” parsing rules do not resolve to a single part of speech is called a train. A train of two or three functions produces a function and (by repeated resolution), a function train of any length also produces a function. A train of three functions <code>fgh</code> behaves like <code>{(⍺f⍵)g⍺h⍵}</code>, that is, <code>f</code> and <code>h</code> are applied to the arguments of the resulting function and the result of these are applied to <code>g</code>. A train of an array and two functions like <code>Afg</code> behaves like <code>{Af⍺g⍵}</code>, this is, <code>g</code> is applied to the arguments of the resulting function and <code>A</code> and that result are applied to <code>f</code>. A train of two functions has a semantic, too, which is explained in the documentation but not used in this example.</p>
<p>In this particular train, one new function, <code>⊢</code> (right tack) is used. It behaves like <code>{⍵}</code>, yielding its right argument. Thus, the entire expression is equal to <code>{.5×⍵+⍺÷⍵}</code>, which is just the iteration step of the Babylonian formula. It is easy to see how tacit notation benefits the golfer; it allows you to shave of quite a few precious characters where applicable.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the <code>⍣</code> (star diæresis), <em>power</em> operator. If the right argument is an array, <code>f⍣A⍵</code> applies <code>f</code> to <code>⍵</code> a total of <code>A</code> times. For instance, <code>f⍣3⍵</code> is equal to <code>fff⍵</code>. The count can be negative, in which case APL tries to infer an inverse function of <code>f</code> and applies that. If the right argument to <code>⍣</code> is a function, too, <code>f⍣g⍵</code> applies <code>f</code> to <code>⍵</code> until <code>(fY)gY</code> where <code>Y</code> is the result of the repeated application of <code>f</code> to <code>⍵</code>. Notably, if <code>g</code> is <code>=</code> (equal) or <code>≡</code> (same), <code>f⍣≡</code> computes a <em>fix point</em> of <code>f</code>. This is exactly what we need for the Babylonian method! We want to iterate until the result converges. Lastly, if <code>⍣</code> applied to a pair of things is invoked as a dyadic function, the left argument is bound to <code>f</code> on the left, i.e. <code>⍺f⍣g⍵</code> is equal to <code>(⍺∘f)⍣g⍵</code> where <code>A∘f</code> behaves like <code>{Af⍵}</code>.</p>

<div id="pu5" class="pu"><h2><strong><a href="http://www.ptc.com/products/mathcad/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mathcad</a></strong></h2>
<p>Well, this is not my favourite language, but this definitely hasn't been covered here, and it looks like a great golfing lang to me!
To those blissed to not know what it is: Mathcad is sort of like a simplified Matlab, but clunkier. It has existed since 1986, and it is one of the oldest software products of its kind.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Mathcad is a purely-procedural programming language with type inference and a really, really weird editor: each operator is added to the program by a keyboard key or combination of keys, but gets displayed on-screen as a (sometimes quite long) keyword.</p>
<p>Oh, and it doesn't support spaces, except in strings. And no tabs or linebreaks. Even if you have a very long line of code. Yes, Mathcad is weird.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>
<p>Here's a simple program in Mathcad:</p>
<p><code>a</code></p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid program. It declares a (global) variable <code>a</code>. Mathcad doesn't have any constants. And, since it uses type inference, this variable can become anything Mathcad can make it, from an integer to a matrix. Cool, huh?</p>
<p>Interesting fact: I call it a &quot;variable&quot;, but, theoretically, Mathcad does not have any global variables, only <em>redefinable global constants</em> that can be <em>redefined</em> to have a new value, albeit only in global scope.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact: that thing is also a function. I'll explain it later. Just believe me for now.</p>
<p>And yes, this declaration is completely, totally useless. You can even say this causes problems as it limits the key shortcuts we can use if we decide to define it in another statement.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>
<p>Here's another simple valid program in Mathcad:</p>
<p><code>a'</code> (equivalent to <code>'a</code>)</p>
<p>Formatted as <code>(a)</code></p>
<p>What does this do? This takes our newly declared <code>a</code> into parentheses! This doesn't do anything really, but is still valid code, too. Parentheses in Mathcad are normally used in arithmetical expressions.</p>
<p>I hope you're beginning to see the sheer weirdness of Mathcad. An apostrophe as a shortcut for parentheses? Who could have ever guessed it? By the way, we will get the same thing if we just type in <code>(a)</code>. But be warned, if you haven't typed in an opening parentheses before <code>a</code> first, no closing one allowed! Why? No idea...</p>
<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>
<p>Time for some <em>real</em> stuff! We can do (global) variable assignment now!
<code>a:1</code> (equivalent to <code>a=1</code> in this case)
Formatted as <code>a:=1</code></p>
<p>We've assigned the value <code>1</code> to our &quot;global variable&quot;, making its type a (signed, no unsigned types in Mathcad) integer. Or, speaking with Mathcad's terms, we &quot;defined the global constant <code>a</code>&quot;. As <code>a</code> wasn't defined before, <code>=</code> maps to global variable assignment as well as <code>:</code> (this won't work if <code>a</code> has been already defined <em>or</em> simply declared). Funny thing: the type is limited to the range of... <code>[-999999999999999, 999999999999999]</code>. Although Mathcad &quot;boasts&quot; calculations on numbers with as long as 17 decimal places, in reality, it will work without error with 15-decimal-place integers maximum even with peak settings (at least on my copy of Mathcad 15). Why does it even count them by decimal places? I can only guess...</p>
<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>
<p>Now, some functions!</p>
<p><code>b(c)</code> (finally something formatted just as typed)</p>
<p>This is a valid piece of code that is actually a function declaration, something like a C function prototype. It declares a function <code>b</code> with one parameter, <code>c</code>. Note that you can't leave the parameter list between the parentheses empty.</p>
<p>Why? Well, the proper Mathcad syntaxis for a 'void'-parameter function is actually... to omit the parentheses. Yep, exactly the same as declaring a &quot;global variable&quot;. In Mathcad, every &quot;global variable&quot; is sort of like a parameterless function that always returns one thing - the value it was initialized to by a definition or a redefinition. I'll demonstrate it later.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and functions can be redefined, just like variables. However, Mathcad has no overloading, so the function called will always be the last one declared. How very, <em>very</em> handy.</p>
<p>Funny thing about our little function declaration: it is just as useless as a &quot;global variable&quot; declaration. It won't allow us to call itself, it won't allow us to use it to call a function with the same signature that will be added later. It will just sit there and be 100% syntactically correct.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>
<p>Let's do something fun with our functions!</p>
<p><code>c:b{1</code> (formatted as <code>c := b ← 1</code>)</p>
<p>Note that this definition raises a warning about redefining a built-in Mathcad unit. Yes, Mathcad is one of those languages that sport a standart library built in right into the language, just like PHP. <code>c</code> is internally defined as a &quot;meters-per-second-speed-floating-point&quot; type variable approximating the speed of light.</p>
<p>So what does our definition do? Nothing important, actually. It is a parameterless function that does one thing: define a local variable b, initialize it to 1, and return the result of the expression, which is also 1.</p>
<p>Actually, Mathcad has an explicit <code>return</code> operator, but it not always needed: Mathcad will return the last thing it sees in the function if it doesn't see the <code>return</code>. Period. Be it a value, a variable, or the result of an expression, it will be returned.</p>
<p>Another funny note: local function variables can have default values if a &quot;constant&quot; of the same name has been declared in the global scope. You can change the local variable's value, but you cannot change its global scope counterpart's value. So yeah, in that sense, Mathcad's &quot;global variables&quot; could be called &quot;constants&quot; (although I think that &quot;weird crap&quot; describes them much better than either of these). So, no shared function state. That's sad since Mathcad gives us no multithreading capabilities to compensate for that.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>
<p>Still not enough space for making a multi-expression function, so let's play with some ranges instead! Also, it's a good time to finally reach (numeric) evaluation.</p>
<p><code>0,2;9=</code> (formatted as <code>0,2 .. 9 = </code>)</p>
<p>This is a standalone expression that defines a range from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> inclusively with a <code>2 - 0 = 2</code> step.</p>
<p>The operator basically works like this: <code>range-start {optional: , range-start + range-step} ; range-end</code></p>
<p>It is then <em>evaluated numerically</em> by the <code>=</code> operator. In Mathcad, &quot;evaluate&quot; = &quot;output&quot;. In this case, it outputs a (vertical) table of all the elements of this range, which are, in this case: <code>0 2 4 6 8</code>.
If you remove <code>,2</code>, the step will default to <code>1</code>, giving you 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>
<p>Ah, finally, &quot;linebreaks&quot; in functions!</p>
<p><code>a:b{1]2</code></p>
<p>Formatted as:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/MEw3P.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is a function that takes no parameters and returns... 2. This demonstrates two things: Mathcad's idiotic &quot;line breaks&quot; and its weird and almost completely useless &quot;sequence-point subblock&quot; construct.</p>
<p>Yes, my friends, this is what Mathcad gives us instead of line breaks. <code>]</code> means &quot;add line after last value, symbol, block in parentheses or empty line&quot;. So, if you want to write an expression on one line and another expression on the next line, you have to <em>first</em> prepare a line for the second expression, and <em>then</em> write the first expression. Otherwise, the last part of your expression ends up in its own small &quot;sequence-point&quot; sub-block. This can be a terrible pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Why do I call it a &quot;sequence-point subblock&quot;? Because it is basically the same as the old <strong>C</strong> parentheses-and-commas sequence-point construct: <code>(expr1, expr2, ..., exprn)</code>. To those of you who do not know what this is: it evaluates all the comma-separated expressions in order and returns the last one. The subblock above does exactly the same: it evaluates the expressions on each line in order and gives out the result of the last one. Yes, this could theoretically be useful in structuring a function. Probably.</p>
<p>By the way, the &quot;sequence-point subblock&quot; can also be used in global context. Just type in a value/symbol/block in parentheses and hit <code>]</code>, then the next one, etc., and when you're done, hit <code>=</code> to get the last value. This can be useful in... um... oh, I give up, it's also totally useless.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>
<p>And here's how you get an expression per line in Mathcad:</p>
<p><code>a:]b↑b{1</code> (from here on, I'll use the arrow symbols in place of the arrow keys).</p>
<p>Formatted as:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/Q0wQN.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is a parameterless function that assigns 1 to b and then returns it.</p>
<p>I think this needs a little explanation. First, we create our function with <code>a:</code>. Then, we add a new line to it with <code>]</code>. The cursor automatically travels to the added line, so we type <code>b</code> there, then use the up-arrow key to return to the previous line, and there initialize <code>b</code> to one.</p>
<p>Of course, this is golfed. In Mathcad, it is easier to add as much lines in advance as you might need, then move your cursor to the first one with the mouse and start typing your expressions, hitting the right-arrow key every time you need to go to the next line. <code>*insert facepalm here*</code></p>

<p><em>Note: [min]mod is too difficult to use for most code challenges, and is a horrible golfing language too. Please tell me whether or not I can still keep this submission here.</em></p>
<p><strong>Factoid:</strong></p>
<p>[min]mod is a language where all data is possibly nested stacks of instructions. Variables storing such stacks can themselves be executed, in which case their contents are executed element by element.</p>
<h2>Length 0 snippet</h2>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/IOBR--qbhU" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it step by step!</a> (click on the <code>program.[m]m</code> file to see the contents, and the play button to execute)</p>
<p>The program is stored in a sub-stack in <code>IS</code>, the built-in instruction stack; so in this case <code>IS</code> stores <code>[[]]</code>. The sub-stack is popped since it doesn't contain any instructions, and the program then terminates since <code>IS</code> is empty.</p>
<h2>Length 1 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>A
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/dzwuCyaPX" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>This will attempt to execute the variable <code>A</code>, and will throw an error since <code>A</code> is uninitialized.</p>
<h2>Length 2 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>IS
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/DMYMAIG8J" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>This is the shortest infinite loop in [min]mod, and one of the shortest valid non-empty programs.</p>
<p>Since the instruction stack is a variable, it can be executed like any other. In this case, the value of the instruction stack will initially be <code>[[IS]]</code>. The program will try to execute the first instruction in <code>IS</code>, which is <code>IS</code> itself, by pushing its contents onto <code>IS</code> as a new sub-stack. At principally the same time, it pops that instruction from <code>IS</code>, making <code>IS</code> now contain <code>[[[IS]] []]]</code>.</p>
<p>Since the first instruction in the first sub-stack in <code>IS</code> is now a stack, it will be popped. Simultaneously, its contents are pushed as a new sub-stack, making <code>IS</code> contain <code>[[IS] [] []]</code>. Now, <code>IS</code> will be executed again, grow, be executed again, grow, and so on forever (assuming the computer has infinite memory).</p>
<h2>Length 3 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>A..
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/YEeoHdZfR" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>Unlike the length 1 snippet, this won't throw an error since it won't actually execute <code>A</code>. The number of periods after an instruction determines its <em>indirection level</em>. An instruction or sub-stack with an indirection level of 0 will be executed, but with an indirection level of one or more, the instruction or sub-stack will instead be pushes onto the data stack, or the <code>DS</code>, which is another built-in variable.</p>
<p>The instruction pushed onto the data stack will have an indirection level one lower than the one executed, so <code>A..</code> pushes <code>A.</code> onto the data stack.</p>
<h2>Length 4 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>A.B.
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/TniUB3OcN" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>Since the program itself is a stack (or, rather, a sub-stack of the instruction stack), one might expect <code>B</code> to be pushed first, since it's presumably the top element of the stack. That's not true, however, since the program stack and its sub-stacks are reversed before being pushed onto <code>IS</code> for that exact reason: it's difficult to write code backwards. In other words, the above program pushes <code>A</code>, <em>then</em> <code>B</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 5 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>[].IF
</code></pre>
<p>This program first <code>[]</code> is pushed onto the data stack. Then, the built-in variable <code>IF</code> is executed. <code>IF</code> contains a special magic instruction that pops once from the data stack, then once more if the first element was an empty stack (or a variable whose value is an empty stack). Here, the stack <em>is</em> empty, but there's no elements left to pop after it's gone, so the program will throw an error.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/9KwZBMkoq" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<h2>Length 6 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>[A].IF
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/EGV-Ci7h0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>Unlike the length 5 snippet, the <code>IF</code> instruction here is applied to a non-empty stack, so it'll only pop once and will therefore not throw an error.</p>
<h2>Length 8 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>B.A.SET
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/KeHirN3ya" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>This program pushes <code>B</code> and <code>A</code> onto <code>DS</code> before executing the <code>SET</code> instruction, which sets the top element of <code>DS</code> to the second element from the top. Since both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are uninitialized, they'll retain their (nonexistent) values, so it would probably make more sense to set <code>A</code> to <code>[]</code> or something.</p>
<h2>Length 9 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>IS.UNWRAP
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/kwcKWb4Hc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>After pushing <code>IS</code> onto <code>DS</code>, the built-in <code>UNWRAP</code> instruction will replace <code>IS</code> with a reference to its value. This means that if the current value of <code>IS</code> changes, so will the stack reference in <code>DS</code>. If <code>IS</code> is reinitialized by the <code>SET</code> instruction, however, the stack reference in <code>DS</code> will still refer to the previous value.</p>
<h2>Length 10 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>[].SET.SET
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://onlinegdb.com/Al9AWab-Q" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it!</a></p>
<p>The built-in variables that makes sense to execute aren't defined as magic instructions, but rather as stacks <em>containing</em> magic instructions. Therefore, they can be given a new value like any other instruction. This program sets <code>SET</code> to an empty stack, making <code>SET</code> a noop and [min]mod Turing-incomplete.</p>

<div id="pu8" class="pu"><h1>Awk</h1>
<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>Awk is a pithy programming language oriented toward string manipulation that also happens to be part of the POSIX standard set of utilities. Awk is named after its original authors, Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. Awk is often used in a pipeline, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230128221202/https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?doi=bc9360202eee91cc204b44345f7903310b94f983" rel="nofollow noreferrer">large programs have been written in it</a> (pdf, 127KB), too.</p>
<h2>0 Characters</h2>
<p>Nothing in life is free: an empty awk program prints nothing and exits successfully. (And seems to be the only awk program that doesn't read standard input.)</p>
<h2>1 Character</h2>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>An awk program consists of patterns and actions. Omit the action and awk assumes <code>{ print }</code>. The above pattern is always true, so <code>awk</code> behaves exactly like <code>cat</code>.</p>
<p>Divergence: Some versions of <code>awk</code>, such as <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Ebwk/btl.mirror/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Kernighan's One True Awk</a> consider both the empty string input and the always-true pattern illegal. <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/awk.html#tag_04_06_13_01" rel="nofollow noreferrer">POSIX says</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either the pattern or the action (including the enclosing brace characters) can be omitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it comes down to whether or not <code>1</code> can be considered a pattern.</p>
<p>I'll try to rationalize the divergence between different versions of awk as long as I get more upvotes.</p>
<h2>2 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>$3
</code></pre>
<p>The above pattern is true if the third field has value. If it does, awk will print the whole line. Thus, as a whole awk program, the above will filter all lines that have fewer than three fields.</p>
<p>Once again, the One True Awk does not consider <code>$3</code> a pattern.</p>
<h2>3 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>int
</code></pre>
<p>BSD treats the above as <code>int($0)</code> and prints every line that can evaluate to a nonzero integer.</p>
<p>Most other awks I tried, including GNU awk consider this invalid. POSIX categorizes <code>int</code> as an <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/awk.html#tag_04_06_13_12" rel="nofollow noreferrer">arithmetic function</a> and says what it does when invoked without parentheses is undefined.</p>
<h2>4 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>NF&lt;4
</code></pre>
<p>This pattern causes Awk to print those records that have fewer than four fields in them. All editions of awk I tested behave consistently.</p>
<h2>5 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>/foo/
</code></pre>
<p>Boring though it may be, it's time to introduce actual regular expressions. This one will match any line containing the string <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code>. This is Awk's bread and butter, and also why it's fairly unnecessary to combine awk and grep.</p>
<h2>6 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>$NF=NR
</code></pre>
<p>This expression overloads the assignment operator <code>=</code> and assigns the number of the current record (row) to the last field. Treating assignments as booleans has the same caveats you might expect from another language. For example <code>$NF=NF</code> would set the last field value to the number of fields, but would skip empty rows.</p>
<h2>7 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>!(NR%2)
</code></pre>
<p>Will print out every other row. It will print the odd ones. I could have written <code>NR%2==0</code> in the same number of characters, which is more flexible because I could also write <code>NR%2==1</code> to get the complementary set of rows. I just picked the most obscure syntax because code golf.</p>
<h2>8 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>!s[$0]++
</code></pre>
<p>is one of my favorite Awk expressions. The first time it sees a line it prints it. It never prints the same series of characters again. It's the tersest stable, sort-free <code>uniq</code> I know.</p>
<h2>9 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>{print$3}
</code></pre>
<p>Print the third column. This is one of those boring, but important, Awk &quot;fundamentals&quot; that hopefully opens the door for cooler things with more characters. It's also our first <em>action</em>. (Remember from <em>1 Character</em> that Awk programs are made up of series of patterns and actions.) Everything heretofore has been just patterns.</p>
<h2>13 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>FNR&lt;3{print}
</code></pre>
<p>Prints the top 2 lines of each file argument.  Obviously the <code>print</code> command is redundant, but there were already examples of shorter code. <code>FNR</code> is the line/record number of the current file; whereas <code>NR</code> represents the total number of lines/records processed from all files.</p>
<h2>14 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>BEGIN{FS=&quot;,&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>BEGIN</code> pattern is true before any files have been processed. <code>FS</code> is the field separator pattern used to divide a line/record into fields. This line assigns the field separator before the first file is processed.  It is equivalent to executing a script with the command-line argument of <code>-F,</code> with the benefit of not being required to remember to add the argument when running the script.</p>
<h2>15 Characters</h2>
<pre><code>END{print FNR}
</code></pre>
<p>Prints the number of lines/records in the last file read. The <code>END</code> pattern is true after all input has been read, similar to <code>wc -l</code></p>

<pre><code>+[![]]
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>![]</code> is <code>false</code>, <code>[![]].toString()</code> is <code>&quot;false&quot;</code>, which isn't a valid number. Therefore, when converting to number, it returns <code>NaN</code>.</p>
<p>I decide to make it here because it's the first time we can create an uppercase letter, and uppercase letter usually take a lot of code to generate.</p>
<h2>Length 5</h2>
<pre><code>+!+[]
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned before (in the length 4 section), <code>!+[]</code> produces <code>true</code>. Also, as mentioned before (in the length 1 section), <code>+</code> can cast to number.</p>
<p>Therefore, this code casts <code>true</code> to number, which is <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>This snippet can be chained indefinitely to produce any number you want.</p>
<p>For example, <code>2</code> would be <code>+!+[]+!+[]</code>, and <code>3</code> would be <code>+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned before (in the length 4 section), <code>+!![]</code> is also valid.</p>
<h2>Length 4</h2>
<pre><code>!+[]
</code></pre>
<p>The operation <code>!</code> casts to boolean.</p>
<p>The number <code>0</code>, the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, the <code>undefined</code>, and the <code>NaN</code> are all treated as <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Other objects are treated as <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike Python, the empty array <code>[]</code> and the empty <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Object_literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">object literal</a> <code>{}</code> are treated as <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is the shortest snippet to produce <code>true</code>. It is equivalent to <code>!0</code>.</p>
<p><code>!![]</code> would also work.</p>
<h2>Length 3</h2>
<pre><code>+[]
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned before, <code>+</code> casts to integer. In this case, it would be evaluated to <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>However, also as mentioned before, <code>+</code> can join two arrays to form a string.</p>
<p>Therefore, <code>+[]+[]</code> is really <code>0+[]</code> which would produce <code>&quot;0&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 2</h2>
<pre><code>++
</code></pre>
<p>There are really only <code>36</code> length-2 snippets.</p>
<p>Out of the <code>36</code> snippets, I chose this one.</p>
<p>This is the shortest way to add <code>1</code> to a number.</p>
<p>This function is very strange.</p>
<p>For example, <code>v=1; ++v</code> works, but <code>++1</code> does not.</p>
<p>For example, <code>v=[]; ++v</code> also works (empty array <code>[]</code> is implicitly cast to <code>0</code>), but <code>++[]</code> does not.</p>
<p>To make it work in JSFuck, you would have to type <code>++[[]][+[]]</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>[[]][+[]]</code> is really <code>[[]][0]</code>, which is an empty array <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>Why <code>++[[]][+[]]</code> works but not <code>++[]</code> is yeond me.</p>
<h2>Length 1</h2>
<pre><code>+
</code></pre>
<p><code>+</code> can convert a string to a number, as well as adding two arrays together to form a string. For example, <code>+&quot;0&quot;</code> would result in the number <code>0</code>, and <code>[1]+[0]</code> will result in the string <code>&quot;10&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>All JSFuck programs are valid Javascript programs. However, JSFuck aims to use only 6 operators to do everything: <code>+![]()</code>. Also, its name is derived from JS (javascript) and Brainfuck. Brainfuck only uses 8 operators.</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>(min-width: 700px)
</code></pre>
<p>This is part of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">media query</a>, which allows certain styles to only show for certain media. Perhaps the most common is min- and max-width, which is the basis of responsive web design, allowing the site to look different depending on the device width. While a news site might expand to fill a widescreen monitor by fitting several stories next to each other, on a phone there is only enough room for one.</p>
<p>The most common way of using media queries is within a stylesheet: the rules are surrounded by <code>{}</code> brackets, prefixed with <code>@media ([rule])</code>, like so: (click &quot;Full page&quot; to see the background color change from tomato to turquoise)</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="false" data-babel="false">

  }
}</code></pre>
</div>

</p>
<p>Media queries can also tell you even more data about a device, such as its resolution, color, and orientation.</p>
<h3>Length 15 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>input:checked
</code></pre>
<p>Another pseudo-selector, this selects all <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s that are checkboxes (or radio buttons or dropdown options) that have been selected by the user. This gives CSS an unintended way to register clicks, allowing for everything from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/functional-css-tabs-revisited/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tabs</a> to <a href="http://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/gpvVZv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a reaction time test</a>.</p>
<p>These work by having a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> for the checkbox that checks the box when clicked anywhere on the text. The checkbox is hidden, leaving just the label. Then the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">adjacent sibling selector</a> <code>+</code> is used to select the label. Here is a simple example (click &quot;Show code snippet&quot;).</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="true" data-console="false" data-babel="false">

<h3>Length 14 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>columns:4 12em
</code></pre>
<p>CSS has the ability to break up long text into several shorter columns, as commonly found in newspapers. The <code>columns</code> property above is shorthand for <code>column-count: 4; column-width: 12em</code>, which tells the browser to break the text into at <em>most</em> 4 columns, at <em>least</em> 12em wide. There are more related properties that allow you to control other aspects, such as gap and rule between columns.</p>
<h3>Length 12 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>display:flex
</code></pre>
<p>This is the code to make flexboxes, which do just what you think: make boxes flexible. This does away with hacky methods developers used and adds a lot of functionality. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSS-Tricks</a> has an excellent guide to all things flexbox that explain them in more detail.</p>
<h3>Length 11 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>:last-child
</code></pre>
<p>This is a pseudo-class that selects each element that is the last child of its parent. For example, take the following HTML code.</p>
<pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Foo&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Baz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A selector of <code>p:last-child</code> would match the Baz paragraph because it is last. However, if there were a different element, say <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, after Baz, that selector would match nothing because there is no <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> that is the last child. For this, you would use <code>p:last-of-type</code>, which ignores all non-paragraph elements and finds only the last <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, regardless of whether it is last overall.</p>
<p>A useful cousin of this selector is <code>:nth-child</code>. It is clear that <code>:nth-child(3)</code> would match the third element, but you can also use more complex queries, such as <code>:nth-child(2n+1)</code>, which matches every other element. This is useful for styling every other row of a long table for easy contrast. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mozilla Developer Network</a> lists several ways to powerfully use <code>nth-child</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 10 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>!important
</code></pre>
<p>This causes other, more specific rules to be overridden. It is placed after a declaration, before the semicolon. Note that in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">most situations</a>, you should not use this, because it can make debugging a nightmare, but I will take this opportunity to talk about <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">specificity</a></em>, which is where the &quot;cascading&quot; in CSS's name comes from.</p>
<p>This basically means that a declaration that applies to a few elements (i.e. it's more specific) will be used in favor of a declaration that applies to more elements. For example, take these HTML and CSS snippets (click &quot;Run code snippet&quot; to see what happens):</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="false" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.green { color: green; }
#red { color: red; }
* { color: blue; }
p { color: yellow; }</code></pre>
<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;p class="green" id="red"&gt;Foo bar&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>You'll notice that even though all three rules match the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, the red color gets applied because it is the most specific: as mentioned below: <code>#red</code> is an ID, which should be unique to only one element, while you can have any number of <code>green</code> classes or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements. The complete specificity order is found in the Mozilla Developer Network page linked above. In the following snippet, nothing has changed except for the addition of <code>!important</code>, but it causes the universal selector, which is the least specific, to take precedence over all the others.</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="false" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.green { color: green; }
#red { color: red; }
* { color: blue !important; }
p { color: yellow; }</code></pre>
<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;p class="green" id="red"&gt;Foo bar&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<h3>Length 9 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>max-width
</code></pre>
<p>This property is pretty self-explanatory: it defines the maximum width an element can have. One common example usage is for a webpage that has large amounts of text, such as a blog post or news article.  You would want the text to take up as much horizontal space as possible on any device, so you'd set the width of each paragraph element to <code>100%</code>. However, on wide screens, lines become too long to navigate comfortably, so you might set the <code>max-width</code> to <code>1000px</code> so the width stops increasing after the window is wider than 1000 pixels. Predictably, there are also <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-height</code> properties.</p>
<h3>Length 8 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>q::after
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a pseudo-element (slightly different from the pseudo-<em>class</em> in the length 6 snippet below) after every <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element, which can be separately styled from the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> itself. This is commonly used with the <code>content</code> property, which allows you to add text that will show up after the element. <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> is used to designate inline quotations, so you would add the declaration <code>content: '&quot;'</code> to automatically add quotation marks after every quote.</p>
<p>As you might guess, there is also a <code>::before</code> pseudo-element which does the same thing, except before the element. The two of these working together can be used to make all sorts of shapes like a heart or star using only one HTML element and CSS (which is based on the <em>box</em> model). You can see many of these and their code on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>
<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>b{top:0
</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the shortest possible full &quot;programs&quot; that can actually do something. It demonstrates the format of a CSS rule: before the braces is the selector, which is usually an HTML tag, class, or ID, but it can also be more advanced, like some of the snippets below. The <code>b</code> in this example selects every HTML <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> (bold text) element.</p>
<p>The inside of the braces are the declarations. (The closing brace of the last rule is optional.) Each declaration is a pair of property and value, separated by semicolons (again, the last semicolon is optional). In this example, <code>top</code> is the property, <code>0</code> is the value, and they are separated by a colon. A more readable and realistic version of the above would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>b {
  top: 0;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 6 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>:hover
</code></pre>
<p>This is a pseudo-class selector that is applied when an element is hovered over with the mouse. You see this all the time, for example in comments on a Stack Exchange site that show upvote and flag buttons on hover, or links that change color when you mouse over them. There are other state selectors like active, focus, and visited.</p>
<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>[alt]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a selector to match any element with the <code>alt</code> attribute (most often used for specifying alternative text if an <code>img</code> cannot be displayed), regardless of what it is or if it is empty. You can use <code>[alt=foo]</code> to only match elements with an <code>alt</code> value of <code>foo</code>. There are several others for attributes containing, beginning with, and ending with a value.</p>
<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>#38b
</code></pre>
<p>CSS uses hex triplets to specify color, which consist of three two-digit hexadecimal numbers, two each for the amount of red, green, and blue present in the color. If both digits in each set are the same, as in <code>#3388bb</code>, it can be shortened to just the first digit of each, as in the snippet above. There are 2<sup>24</sup> = 16777216 possible colors. The color is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/DA5UL.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/DA5UL.png" alt="#38b" /></a><br />

<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>p#s
</code></pre>
<p>This matches a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (paragraph) element with the ID <code>s</code>. IDs are similar to classes, which are explained below, except classes can be used on any number of elements and an element can have multiple classes, whereas each ID should only be used once, and elements can only have one ID.</p>
<p>IDs can also be used as targets, where a link to an ID links directly to that element on the page. For example, a link to this question ending in <code>#49172</code> will link directly to this answer, because it has ID <code>49172</code>. You can chain IDs and classes: <code>.a#b.c</code> matches an element with ID <code>b</code> and classes <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.a
</code></pre>
<p>This matches an element with the class <code>a</code>, used for styling multiple instances of a style. For example, you might use <code>&lt;a class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;</code> for styling only external links, different from all links.</p>
<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>*
</code></pre>
<p>This is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">universal selector</a>. It matches any element on the page, although it is the most expensive selector.</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is not your typical programming language, as it is used for styling HTML web pages, but I thought it still would be interesting for this challenge.</p>
<p>CSS came at a time when design on the Internet was a mess, with designers abusing HTML for styling purposes (<code>&lt;table&gt;</code> has never been the same). Adoption wasn't consistent across browsers, causing headaches for designers who had to resort to &quot;hacks&quot; to get their code to work cross-browser. These different implementations continue to this day, although much better, in the form of vendor prefixes.</p>

<p><strong>Japt</strong> is a shortened version of <strong>Ja</strong>vaScri<strong>pt</strong>, created by myself in early November 2015.</p>
<h2>Click on any snippet's header to try it in the <a href="http://ethproductions.github.io/japt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter!</a></h2>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Japt is heavily based off of JavaScript. After transpiling Japt's syntax features to JS, it is evaluated as vanilla JS. This allows easy building of an online interpreter.</p>
<h3><a href="http://ethproductions.github.io/japt?v=master&amp;code=0A==&amp;input=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 1</a></h3>
<pre><code>Ð
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, the letter Eth. <em>(Don't tell anyone, but it's my personal favorite.)</em> This is the first example of one of Japt's defining features: <strong>Unicode shortcuts</strong>. Each one-byte character from <code>¡</code> to <code>Þ</code> has or will be assigned two or more chars to stand in for. <code>Ð</code> happens to stand for <code>new Date(</code>.</p>
<p>Another nifty feature is that <strong>missing parentheses are automatically added</strong>. This code transpiles to:</p>
<pre><code>new Date()
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, <strong>implicit output</strong>: The last expression (separated by <code>;</code>) is automatically sent to the output box. On my computer, the output comes up like so:</p>
<pre><code>Sun Nov 29 2015 09:37:30 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)
</code></pre>
<p>One important thing to note is that in the interest of saving bytes, Japt replaces each close-paren with two close-parens, and each space with one. So instead of writing</p>
<pre><code>Ð)+1
</code></pre>
<p>you would have to write</p>
<pre><code>Ð +1
</code></pre>

<pre><code>U²
</code></pre>
<p>Now we get to <strong>implicit input</strong>: <code>N</code> is pre-defined to the evaluated input. <code>U</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>W</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code> are set to the first six items. If there are less than six items in the input, the remaining vars are set to 0 instead.</p>
<p>Also, the Unicode shortcut <code>²</code> is set to <code>p2 </code>. This means that the code is really <code>Up2</code>. All lower­case letters are reserved for <strong>methods</strong>, and are transpiled to e.g. <code>.a(</code>. This makes the code</p>
<pre><code>U.p(2)
</code></pre>
<p>Japt has three main <strong>data types</strong>: strings, arrays, and numbers. And all three of these have different meanings for <code>.p()</code>. Here's what happens with the different input types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>string.p()</code> = <code>.repeat()</code>, so the input is repeated twice and outputted.</li>
<li><code>array.p()</code> = <code>.push()</code>, so <code>2</code> is added to the end of the array, and its new length is outputted.</li>
<li><code>number.p()</code> = <code>.pow()</code> (hence the shortcut being <code>²</code>), so the input is squared and outputted.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Uæq
</code></pre>
<p>One of Japt's main strengths is its large selection of <strong>array manipulation functions</strong>. There are many helpful functions that we could use on arrays; more than the 26 lowercase letters can hold. So to get around this limit, we can use the lowercase accented letters in the range <code>à-ÿ</code>. <code>æ</code> returns the first item in the array that returns truthily when run through a function.</p>
<p>Another strength is <strong>auto-functions</strong>: if a lowercase letter is given in place of a function, it transpiles to e.g. <code>function(c){return c.q()}</code>.</p>
<p>So, this code returns the first item whose <code>.q()</code> returns with a truthy value. But what is truthy? As it turns out, almost everything: the only values in JS that are not truthy are <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>null</code>, and <code>undefined</code>. And <code>q</code> is square root on numbers, which returns <code>NaN</code> for negatives and <code>0</code> for 0. So if the input is an array of numbers, this returns the first positive one:</p>
<pre><code>-3   NaN    falsy
 0   0      falsy
-6   NaN    falsy
 7  ~2.646  truthy!
 4   2      truthy
-1   NaN    falsy
</code></pre>
<p>This example returns <code>7</code>. But what about non-numbers? <code>q</code> splits a string into chars, and joins an array, so the only falsy value that's not a number will be the empty array:</p>
<pre><code>[]       &quot;&quot;         falsy
[1,2,3]  &quot;123&quot;      truthy!
&quot;&quot;       []         truthy
&quot;abc&quot;    ['a,'b,'c] truthy
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>q</code> trick has many other applications, which we will look at later.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at <strong>functions</strong> now. <code>¡</code> stands for <code>Um@</code>, and <code>@</code> stands for <code>XYZ{</code>, which is transpiled to <code>function(X,Y,Z){</code>. So here we have:</p>

<p>This results in a whole tree of possible outputs, depending on the types of <code>U</code> and <code>V</code>:</p>

<pre><code>`HÁM!
</code></pre>
<p>Believe it or not, this doesn't give the user a ham. ;) On the contrary, it outputs a warm welcome:</p>
<pre><code>Hello!
</code></pre>
<p>How does this work, you ask? Well, the secret lies in the backtick: Japt uses the <a href="http://ed-von-schleck.github.io/shoco/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shoco library</a> for <strong>string compression</strong>. To compress text, you call <code>Oc</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>Oc&quot;Hello!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you the compressed string. To decompress, you can do one of two things: 1) Use <code>Od&quot;...&quot;</code>, or 2) wrap the text in backticks. This is why Japt is shorter in the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/63338/42545">&quot;Hello, World!&quot; challenge</a> than almost every other language that doesn't have a built-in for &quot;Hello, World!&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing: If you have a quotation mark or backtick (or dollar sign, or curly bracket, or parenthesis, or any combination of the above) at the end of a program, you can leave it off, saving an extra 1 or more bytes.</p>
<h3><a href="http://ethproductions.github.io/japt?v=master&amp;code=Va6krHJe&amp;input=WzAgMSAyIDMgNCA2IDggMTIgMTYgMjQgMzcgMTI3IDEwMjkwOF0=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 6</a></h3>
<pre><code>U®¤¬r^
</code></pre>
<p>Lots of Unicode shortcuts here: <code>®</code> stands for <code>m_</code>, and <code>_</code> stands for <code>Z{Z</code>. <code>¤</code> stands for <code>s2 </code>, and <code>¬</code> stands for <code>q </code>. Putting this all together, we get:</p>
<pre><code>UmZ{Zs2 q r^
</code></pre>
<p>If the input is an array of numbers, this maps each item <code>Z</code> to <code>Z.toString(2).split(&quot;&quot;)</code>. But what is that <code>r^</code> at the end? <code>array.r()</code> is the <code>reduce</code> function, which takes in a function of at least two parameters, and uses that function to combine each item with the previous value. As an example:</p>
<pre><code>[0,1,2,3,4]rXY{X+Y
</code></pre>
<p>This reduces the array with addition. The result is 10; it works like this:</p>
<pre><code>prev value: 0; next value: 1; result: 1
prev value: 1; next value: 2; result: 3
prev value: 3; next value: 3; result: 6
prev value: 6; next value: 4; result: 10.
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>^</code> is not a function, so what happens? Japt has a nice feature where if the first thing inside parentheses is an operator, it's transpiled to a function which takes in two arguments, and returns the result of the args being combined with that operator. So this whole program ends up as:</p>
<pre><code>U.m(function(Z){return Z.s(2).q().r(function(a,b){return a^b})})
</code></pre>
<p>Which maps through each number, turns it to its an array of its binary digits, and finally returns <code>1</code> if this contains an odd number of <code>1</code>s, and <code>0</code> otherwise.</p>

<pre><code>Uà ®r!-
</code></pre>
<p>More array manipulation: <code>à</code> returns all possible combinations of the array. You've already seen that <code>®</code> is a shortcut for <code>m_</code>, and that <code>r-</code> would reduce by subtraction. But what does <code>r!-</code> mean? The difference is simple: an operator preceded by <code>!</code> reverses the order of the resulting function's arguments. Here's exactly how this works:</p>
<pre><code>Code  Transpiled
r-    .r(function(a,b){return a-b})
r!-   .r(function(a,b){return b-a})
</code></pre>
<p>After putting this all together, we end up with:</p>
<pre><code>U.à().m(function(Z){return Z.r(function(a,b){return b-a})})
</code></pre>
<p>This takes all possible combinations of the input array, then reduces each by subtracting the previous result from the current item. For example, <code>[1 3 7]</code> becomes:</p>
<pre><code>Comb.    Reduction       Result

<p>Hooray for array manipulation! <code>å</code> is a cumulative reduce (i.e. like <code>r</code>, but returns an array of each intermediate value), and <code>ä</code> maps each adjacent pair of items through the function. As shown before, <code>¬</code> becomes <code>q </code>, which performs square root on numbers. So if the input is an array of numbers, <code>fq </code> filters out the non-positive ones, as shown in Snippet 3. Let's try it:</p>
<pre><code>U   [1,2,-3,5,0,7]  [1,0,-1,1,1,0,1,1]
f¬  [1,2,5,7]       [1,1,1,1,1]

<p><code>q</code> has even more potential in this area, which will be demonstrated in a future snippet. This program is obviously not super useful, but hey, messing around with math is fun. :)</p>

<pre><code>+² Æn -X²
</code></pre>
<p>Here I wanted to showcase one of the features which has the largest impact on the order of inputs: Auto-insertion (specifically of <code>U</code> in this case).</p>
<p>In some situations, attempting to use a method or operator when there is no value immediately to the left of it will cause the transpiler to insert a variable of its own instead of giving an error. In this snippet these three rules are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of a line, <code>U</code> will be inserted</li>
<li>At the start of a function, <code>U</code> will be inserted</li>
<li>At the right side of an operator, when the left side is a single variable, the same variable will be inserted</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus this piece of code is identical to the snippet above after auto-insertions and without shortcuts:</p>
<pre><code>U+Up2  oXYZ{Un -Xp2
^ ^         ^
| |         | Auto-inserted at the beginning of a function
| |
| | Auto-inserted because the left side is just &quot;U&quot;
|
| Auto-inserted at the beginning of a line
</code></pre>
<p>What the code does is compute the sum of U and U squared, and then for each value X in the range from 0 to that sum it outputs -U minus X squared. This exact snippet isn't particularly useful, but auto-insertion definitely can save a few bytes especially if you pick the right order of inputs.</p>

which is invented in 1970 (2 years older than C) by Professor Niklaus Wirth .
Original Pascal is procedural .</p>
<p>Because of its easy syntax and perfect efficiency , many programs have been made using Pascal . some examples are :<em>TeX - Apple Lisa - Total Commender - Skype</em></p>
<p>Major Implementations are : <em>Gnu Pascal - Free Pascal - Turbo Pascal - Borland Pascal</em></p>

<p>This is a dot ! Any pascal program must end with &quot;.&quot; even if it is possible to be terminated in the middle . This dot is usually written after an <code>end</code> .
To terminate the program somewhere at the middle of execution , you need to use <code>halt</code> command</p>
<pre class="lang-pascal prettyprint-override"><code>;

<p>This 'language' is the combination of an interpreted language, GP, a C library called PARI, and a REPL called gp. It is a domain-specific language, specializing in algebraic number theory. You can do math very easily in GP, but some things (like string manipulation) are impractical.</p>
<p>Length 1: <code>'</code></p>
<p>This command can be used to quote, but not in the usual way. <code>'x</code> means &quot;the literal polynomial x, not the value in the variable x&quot;. In postfix, it means the derivative. Tricky example: <code>'x'</code> is 1 -- the derivative of the polynomial x. (But it is the 0th-degree polynomial 1, not the integer 1: <code>'x'==1</code> is true, but <code>'x'===1</code> is false since <code>type('x')</code> is <code>&quot;t_POL&quot;</code> not <code>&quot;t_INT&quot;</code>.) <code>'</code> can also be used on functions, where it means the numerical derivative: <code>sin'(x)</code> is the same as <code>cos(x)</code>, up to roundoff error at least.</p>
<p>Length 2: <code>&lt;-</code></p>
<p>This command is used in set-builder notation. If you want to take a vector <code>v</code> and select only those values which satisfy <code>f(x)</code>, you can run <code>[x | x &lt;- v, f(x)]</code>. You can also use <code>[g(x) | x &lt;- v, f(x)]</code> to apply the function <code>g</code> to all such terms.</p>
<p>Length 3: <code>Mod</code></p>
<p>Most languages have a modulus operator, but GP also has the command <code>Mod</code>, which converts a number into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integer-mod-m</a> object. You can then do exponentiation, division, and other operations naturally, and they are fast. So <code>(99^8388607)%8388607</code> is slow (2 seconds) while <code>Mod(99, 8388607)^8388607</code> is fast (less than a microsecond). You can also use this to do modular inversion using the extended Euclidean algorithm: <code>1/Mod(3,7)</code> gives <code>Mod(5,7)</code> because (3*5)%7 = 1. (See also <code>gcdext</code>.)</p>
<p>Length 4: <code>fold</code></p>
<p>This command allows a vector to be combined pairwise with a given function. Note that some functions already fold automatically where that would be useful: <code>lcm</code>, <code>gcd</code>, <code>Str</code>, and (in some sense) <code>chinese</code>.</p>
<p>Length 5: <code>3^3^3</code></p>
<p>This yields 7625597484987, demonstrating not only that <code>^</code> represents exponentiation rather than a bitwise operator but that exponentiation is right-associative. This is the mathematical convention, but many other languages are left-associative instead, giving the much smaller 19683. See <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Operator_precedence#PARI.2FGP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PARI/GP Operator Precedence</a> or section 2.4 in the <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/manuals/2.7.0/users.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">User's Guide to PARI/GP</a>.</p>
<p>Length 6: <code>fordiv</code></p>
<p>GP has many types of loops built in which go beyond the standard C-style <code>for</code>, <code>do</code>, and <code>while</code>. This one takes a number and loops once for each of its divisors, setting the dummy variable equal to the divisor itself. There is also the summation version <code>sumdiv</code> which adds up all the results of the inner loop. Thus <code>sumdiv(720720, n, n^2)</code> gives the sum of the squares of the divisors of 720720. (You could already do this with <code>sigma(720720, 2)</code> but this version is more customizable.) Note also that fast factorization techniques are used, not just trial division, so the result is computed quickly.</p>
<p>Length 7: <code>V ec(x)</code></p>
<p>This demonstrates two principles of GP. First is the ability to convert between different forms with conversion commands like <code>Pol</code> (polynomial), <code>Vec</code> (vector), <code>Vecsmall</code> (vector of small integers), <code>Set</code> (set), <code>Mat</code> (matrix), etc. Second is the fact that the parser completely ignores spaces, so <code>V ec</code> is the same as <code>Vec</code>. Space is added only for readability. This can, however, have interesting effects on constrained coding!</p>
<p>Length 8: <code>eta(I/4)</code></p>
<p>PARI/GP includes a large number of built-in special functions. eta(z) represents an infinite product (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_eta_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dedekind eta function</a>) and is computed efficiently, but you can also compute this instance 'directly' as <code>prodinf(n=1,1-exp(-Pi*n/2))</code>.</p>
<p>Length 9: <code>asinh('x)</code></p>
<p>As hinted at by the first snippet, <code>'</code> means that x is to be treated as a formal variable. (By default it, and all other variables, are purely formal, but you could also assign to it: <code>x=1</code>, for example. If you haven't assigned to it you can drop the <code>'</code>.) When the inverse hyperbolic sine function gets an argument which includes a formal variable, it computes a Maclaurin series in that variable, so this results in <code>x - 1/6*x^3 + ...</code> where the terms continue depending on your settings (<code>default(seriesprecision)</code> controls these settings). You can also force GP to use a desired number of terms with the <code>O</code> command:  <code>asinh(x+O(x^4))</code>.</p>
<p>Length 10: <code>-eint1(-9)</code></p>
<p><code>eint1</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_integral" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exponential integral</a>, which can be used (among other things!) to estimate the number of primes up to a certain number. This provides an estimate for the number of primes up to <em>e</em><sup>9</sup>, and it's pretty good: the exact answer is 1019 and this gives about 1037.</p>
<p>Length 11: <code>teichmuller</code></p>
<p><code>teichmuller(x)</code> gives the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teichm%C3%BCller_character" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Teichmüller character</a> of <em>x</em>, that is, the unique (<em>p</em>-1)-th root of unity congruent to x / p^k modulo p with k maximal. PARI/GP has strong support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_field_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">class field theory</a> and has many nontrivial functions built in.</p>
<p>Length 12: <code>hilbert(3,5)</code></p>
<p>Computes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_symbol" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hilbert symbol</a> of 3 and 5. Since the third argument is not given, the command defaults to doing the calculation 'at infinity', that is, the completion is the real numbers. You could also pass a prime <em>p</em> in which case it would instead use the <em>p</em>-adic numbers as the completion.</p>
<p>Length 13: <code>thue(x^2+3,7)</code></p>
<p>This is where GP's specialized functions begin to shine. <code>thue</code> solves a <a href="http://www.math.uoc.gr/~tzanakis/Papers/PracticalSolutionThueEq.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Thue equation</a>, which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_polynomial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">irreducible</a> bivariate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">homogeneous polynomial</a> of degree at least 3. This example uses <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3 <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 7, which has four integer solutions. This command has many additional options, for which see the help entries <code>??thue</code> and <code>??thueinit</code>. Note that although the polynomial of interest is bivariate and homogeneous, it is entered in GP as an inhomogeneous univariate polynomial. This can be achieved by setting either variable to 1.</p>
<p>Length 14: <code>Vec(eta('x)^2)</code></p>
<p>This computes the Taylor series of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_eta_function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dedekind eta function</a>, squares it, and returns the coefficients. This is a slick way to compute sequence <a href="https://oeis.org/A002107" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A002107</a> in the OEIS, the number of partitions of a number into an even number of distinct parts minus number of partitions of the same number into an odd number of distinct parts, with 2 types of each part. (Replacing the <code>2</code> in the program with a different number changes the number of parts accordingly; using 1, for instance, yields <a href="https://oeis.org/A010815" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A010815</a> instead.)</p>

<p>This is probably one of the most used trigraphs in my <code>zsh</code> answers, but what does it do?</p>
<p>Well, the parts in isolation are <code>$1</code> is the first command-line argument, and <code>&gt;</code> redirects a command to a file. But there is no command? Ah, but when no command is provided, <code>zsh</code> uses the value of the <code>NULLCMD</code> environment variable, or <code>cat</code> by default. Therefore, it <code>cat</code>s all of <code>stdin</code> to a file named the first command-line argument. <code>stdin</code> is generally not the optimal input method, and therefore I don't use it often, so it doesn't generally matter what goes into the file, but it matters that the file is created.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>Why does it matter that we create a file? Because the shortest way to do string pattern-matching in <code>zsh</code> is with so-called &quot;globbing&quot;. A glob pattern-matches to a file. I've given an overview of globbing syntax <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/219491">here</a>, but it's generally the easiest and shortest way to check if two strings are equal, or check for substrings or match all sorts of patterns (especially with the <code>--extendedglob</code> option). You can even create patterns dynamically, like I used in my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/217969"><em>Is it a lobster number?</em> answer</a>.</p>
<p><sub>[1] If <code>stdin</code> is really needed, you can use <code>:&gt;$1</code> which pipes a no-op command, or enable the <code>--shnullcmd</code> option which changes that <code>cat</code> default to a no-op</sub></p>
<h2>4 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>echo
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>echo</code> builtin prints a string, like <code>echo hello</code>. Pretty simple, right? But we can actually do 2 bytes better, with the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;hello
</code></pre>
<p>This is called &quot;here-string&quot; redirection, and it's equivalent to doing <code>echo hello | command</code>. Like before, there is no command, however, so it's passed to <code>cat</code> (see <code>NULLCMD</code> above) and hence to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> syntax has some limitations, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>it only expects a single word, so some expansion/word splitting techniques don't work</li>
<li>the expression on the right is evaluated in a subshell, so assigning variables there won't take effect outside the command</li>
<li>it's not a true command, so it can't be aliased and can't always be used in some complex statements</li>
<li>if you want to print only a newline, a bare <code>echo</code> is one byte shorter than <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>...but it can be chained without command separators, like <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;a&lt;&lt;&lt;b</code>, because multiple redirections are going to <code>cat</code> (thanks to multIOs). This is particurlarly useful in <code>eval</code> &quot;loops&quot; (see <strong>7 bytes</strong>)</p>
<h2>5 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>set -y
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike most shells, zsh does not perform field splitting by default, so variable expansions almost never need to be quoted. The <code>-y</code> option re-enables such splitting, which is useful in some circumstances.</p>
<p><code>zsh</code> in fact has <a href="https://tio.run/##qyrO@P@/qjhDQVc3IzWn4P9/AA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a plethora of command-line options</a>, most of which can also be set dynamically with <code>set</code>, <code>setopt</code>, or <code>unsetopt</code>; some more interesting options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-e</code>: errors are no longer ignored, and the shell exits immediately if one happens. If you can generate errors in some circumstances, this can act like a logical AND over the program which is useful for <a href="/questions/tagged/decision-problem" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;decision-problem&#39;" rel="tag">decision-problem</a>s</li>
<li><code>-n</code>: <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/218012">disables all command execution</a>. Who knows why...</li>
<li><code>--extendedglob</code>: enables a whole load of extra syntax goodies for globbing</li>
<li><code>-F</code>: globbing is disabled. This is useful if you don't need to do any pattern matching but want to include unquoted special characters like <code>*</code>. Particularly useful in <a href="/questions/tagged/ascii-art" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ascii-art&#39;" rel="tag">ascii-art</a></li>
<li><code>--forcefloat</code>: changes division in arithemtic expansions to always produce a <code>float</code>, even if both operands are integers</li>
<li><code>--cprecedences</code>: changes operator precedence of bitwise operators in arithmetic expansions. By default they are tighter-binding than even exponentiation, and this makes them exactly as they are in C[2]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the full documentation for all of these in <code>man zshoptions</code>.</p>
<p><sub>[2] although this still isn't the most sensible, as comparison operators are tighter than bitwise AND/XOR/OR<sub>, in what may go down in history as Dennis Ritchie's greatest mistake</sub></sub></p>
<h2>6 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>hash -d
</code></pre>
<p>While not so useful in <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a>, but this provides a mechanism very handy for interactive command-prompt use of <code>zsh</code>. You may know that <code>~</code> refers to the home directory; well now you can define more directory aliases of the form <code>~a</code>. For example, <code>hash -d a=/usr/local</code> means that <code>echo ~a/bin/cat</code> will print <code>/usr/local/bin/cat</code>.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/219712">might be useful</a> in <a href="/questions/tagged/restricted-source" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;restricted-source&#39;" rel="tag">restricted-source</a>, but I haven't actually found a use for it yet outside my dotfiles.</p>
<h2>7 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>{1..$1}
</code></pre>
<p><code>{1..$1}</code> constructs a range from <code>1</code> to the input, and expands them as separate words. This alone is not too interesting, but if you put some more string around it, like <code>x{1..$1}y</code>, then it can create a range with the string, like <code>x1y x2y x3y ...</code>. If you replace <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with partial snippets of <code>zsh</code> code, and then pass them to the <code>eval</code> builtin (which evaluates strings as <code>zsh</code> code), you can construct ugly-looking loops, which are often shorter than using <code>for</code>.</p>
<h2>8 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>${a/w/} 
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>${...}</code> construct introduces parameter expansion. In the above example we are doing a text replacement on variable <code>$a</code>, and removing any <code>w</code> characters from its contents. Zsh has a pretty reasonable regex engine. Parameter expansion also does tricky things with arrays and expansion flags. <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/233823">Example</a></p>
<h2>9 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>alias A=B
</code></pre>
<p><code>alias</code> defines token aliases (in the sense of C pre-processor macros), so in the example above, <code>A</code> will be replaced with <code>B</code> in parsing. If you're using a particular construct often, this can shorten it. For example, to output a lot of stuff, you can do[4]:</p>
<pre><code>alias A=repeat\ 1000000
alias B='A A A A'
alias C='B B B B'
C C C C echo hi
</code></pre>
<p>With a little syntactic trickery, you can even alias operators:</p>
<pre><code>alias X='&amp;&amp;'
(true)X echo hi
# =&gt; hi
(false)X echo hi
# no output
</code></pre>
<p><sub>[3] Actually, for normal commands alone, it's shorter to define a function: <code>A()command $@;</code></sub>
<sub>[4] This is by far non-optimal for the most finite output, but what ever</sub></p>
<h2>10 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>emulate sh
</code></pre>
<p>zsh has a built-in command to make its behaviour much more closely mirror the POSIX shell standard (and it can also emulate <code>csh</code> and <code>ksh</code>). I don't think it will ever have a use in <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a>, except maybe <a href="/questions/tagged/cops-and-robbers" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;cops-and-robbers&#39;" rel="tag">cops-and-robbers</a> or <a href="/questions/tagged/polyglot" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;polyglot&#39;" rel="tag">polyglot</a>, but it's another reason that <code>zsh</code> should be the only shell installed on your system.</p>
<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>Who needs <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code>, or half of the other core unix utils when you can write simple Zsh code like the following from the <a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide05.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Zsh User Guide</a>?</p>

<h2>Length 2 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>i?
</code></pre>
<p>A simple cat program that infinitely echoes stdin to stdout. <code>i</code> fetches one character of input, which is then outputted using <code>?</code>, and then the instruction pointer loops back to the start.</p>
<h2>Length 3 snippet</h2>
<pre><code>'A?
</code></pre>
<p>Prints the character <code>A</code> indefinitely. Why do you only need an opening quote, and not a closing quote? Simply because I thought that there is no need for a closing quote, since a character can only be, well, one character long.</p>
<h2>Length 4 snippet</h2>

<p>This program does not output <code>12</code>, as one might expect, but only outputs <code>2</code>. Remember: every command is a single character long. First one is pushed to the stack, then two, then the top value of the stack is printed as a number, then the program halts.</p>

<div id="pu21" class="pu"><h1>C#</h1>
<p>C# is a fun, crazy mix of features from Java, C, Haskell, SQL, and a ton of other languages, and it provides a lot of really nice features and APIs.  It's also known around here for being pretty verbose, but we'll see what we can do!</p>
<p>I'll ignore the usual required boilerplate (no longer required in C#9.0):</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>class Program { public static void Main(string[] args) { ... } }
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 1:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>;
</code></pre>
<p>Commands are terminated with semicolons in C#! An empty line is perfectly valid syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>x=5f;
</code></pre>
<p>When you specify literal numbers in C#, the compiler will assume that they are ints or doubles (based on whether they have a decimal point). If you want to use a literal float, you should specify that by appending 'f' to the number, or it will be cast at runtime, incurring a slight cost.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7 (bytes):</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>s=@&quot;
&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>If you prefix a string literal with an @ sign, it becomes a &quot;verbatim&quot; string literal. Normal string literals parse escape sequences like '\n' into special characters, but verbatim literals don't, allowing you to use the backslash character without escaping it. They can also include line returns, as shown. That could save you a few bytes in golf, or make your multi-line string literals more readable. Just watch out for indentation being included in the string.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>()=&gt;x=y;
</code></pre>
<p>This expression is an anonymous function. It returns an object of type <code>Action</code> that can be passed around and also called like a function. Anonymous functions inherit the scope in which they were declared, and they pull any local variables in that scope with them anywhere they go.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>(a)=&gt;a.p;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another anonymous function that uses a parameter and return value. The expression returns an object of type <code>Func</code> (the Func itself returns the type of <code>a.p</code>. You'll use <code>Func</code> a lot to interface with Linq.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>enm.Any();
</code></pre>
<p>This is our first introduction to Linq! Linq is a set of extension methods that can be called on any object that is enumerable (implementing the IEnumerable interface) - like <code>Array</code> and <code>List</code>. IEnumerable employs lazy evaluation: it goes through the collection one item at a time, without knowing about the collection as a whole - it could even be infinite!</p>
<p>That's where <code>Any</code> comes in - it returns <code>true</code> if the Enumerable contains at least 1 item. Much better than calculating out the whole length.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>var a=1.5f;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>var</code> keyword instructs the compiler to automatically determine the type of <code>a</code>. <code>a</code> in this case will be typed as <code>Single</code>. Very handy for code golf, as it's shorter by far than almost any type name, though many dislike using it in production code.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>yield return 0;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a crazy statement you may be less familiar with. You know that objects can be enumerable by inheriting IEnumerable, but did you know that <em>functions</em> can be enumerable? Declare a function with a return type of <code>IEnumerable</code>, and have it <code>yield return</code> as many times as you want. When you get an Enumerator to the function, each call to <code>GetNext</code> will have the program execute all the code up to the next <code>yield return</code>, return that value, and then pause until you advance it again. You use <code>yield break</code> to end the iteration.</p>
<p><strong>Length 16:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>[Obsolete]int a;
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet shows an attribute. An attribute is a kind of tag you can stick on any declaration in your code. Some instruct the compiler to do certain things, like this one that emits an Obsolete warning if you call <code>a</code>. You can create your own by extending <code>Attribute</code>, and you can query them using Reflection (more on that later, perhaps). You can go meta and restrict what kind of declarations an attribute can be used on with the <code>AttributeUsage</code> attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>c.Count(t=&gt;t==3);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a handy golf method. Given a <code>Func</code> that maps an element of the enumerable <code>c</code> to <code>bool</code>, it returns the number of elements in <code>c</code> for which that <code>Func</code> returns <code>true</code>. Much nicer than writing out a loop.</p>
<p><strong>Length 18:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>foreach(T t in c);
</code></pre>
<p>This is a for-each loop. With all this talk of enumerable things, this is a much-needed structure. <code>foreach</code> is syntactic sugar that will set up an Enumerator for <code>c</code> (which must be enumerable) and iterate through it one element <code>t</code> at a time. You can alter or examine each individual element, but altering the collection itself will invalidate the enumerator.</p>
<p><strong>Length 19</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>c.Select(t=&gt;t.a/2);
</code></pre>
<p>This is your 'map' function, for functional programming fans. Select is a nice concise way to perform some arbitrary conversion (defined by a <code>Func</code> passed in) on each element of an enumerable. It returns an IEnumerable that will spit out the &quot;converted&quot; elements when you iterate it.</p>
<p><strong>Length 21</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Console.Write(&quot;Hi!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This line writes some text to stdout, and is probably one of the main reasons C# isn't used for golfing much!</p>
<p><strong>Length 23</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>typeof(T).GetMethods();
</code></pre>
<p>C# supports a very powerful feature called Reflection. Reflection lets you examine the structure of your code at runtime. For example, this call will return an Array of all methods on the specified type. You can examine those methods, call them, or even modify the values of fields and properties. Attributes (see Length 16) are a good way to tag parts of your code for use with Reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Length 25</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>from t in c select t.a/2;
</code></pre>
<p>Is that SQL? In C# code? Pretty close. This expression does the same thing as the one at Length 19.</p>
<p><strong>Length 27</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>for(var l;;l=new object());
</code></pre>
<p>C# is a garbage-collected language, which means that any memory you allocate (using the <code>new</code> keyword) can be automatically released as long as no references to it exist. This code will run happily forever even though I never explicitly free the memory created. Garbage collection has costs, though - search the web to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Length 29</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>var e=Enumerable.Range(0,99);
</code></pre>
<p><code>Enumerable.Range</code> is a potentially handy golf function. It returns a structure that can be enumerated and will yield each number in the range specified, in order. The second parameter is a count, not an index.</p>
<p><strong>Length 31</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public int pr{get;private set;}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can show a simple 'property', an OOP feature and another hallmark of C#. If you've ever used Java, you've probably made 'get' and 'set' methods for a field in order to separate their accessibility or run code when it's changed. Well, C# lets you declare that code right on top of the field, and also set separate access modifiers for getting and setting. This particular snippet automatically creates a default getter and setter, but makes the setter private.</p>
<p><strong>Length 32</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>public static void m(this T o){}
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet shows a C# feature that's nice for API design. By applying the <code>this</code> modifier to the first parameter of a static method, that method becomes an &quot;extension&quot; method. Once this is declared, <code>T.m</code> can now be called on any object of type T as though it were actually a method of T. This can be used to add new functionality to any existing class, without modifying or even having access to its source code.</p>
<p><strong>Length 38</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>int f(int a,ref int b,out int c){c=0;}
</code></pre>
<p>This method showcases different types of parameter passing you can have in C#. Unmodified parameters are <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/%7Emyers/c++/notes/references.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">passed by value</a>. Parameters prefixed by <code>ref</code> are passed by reference: you can assign a completely new object to them and they will carry it back out of the method. Parameters prefixed by <code>out</code> are like additional return values: you are required to assign them a value in the method, and they are carried back out just like ref parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Length 42</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>Console.Write(&quot;It is \{DateTime.Now()}.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The new C# 6 standard can save you some characters when you have to output assembled strings, using string interpolation. This feature allows you to write any expression in curly braces inside a string literal, and the string will be automatically assembled with the values of those expressions at runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Length 48</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>IEnumerable f(){for(int a=0;;)yield return a++;}
</code></pre>
<p>Just enough characters now to do something with an actual purpose! This method uses some of ideas we explored above to create an infinite Enumerable that will simply return the integers, one-by-one, starting with 0. Remember that C# employs lazy evaluation with Enumerables, so an infinite sequence is perfectly valid - you can iterate as much of the sequence as you want, and break out at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Length 56</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>int p{get{return mP;}set{mP=Math.Max(value,0);}};int mP;
</code></pre>
<p>Here is another example of a 'property' (see snippet 31). Here, I have actually defined different code snippets for <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> rather than using the automatic ones as before. This example demonstrates how you can use a property to validate the value assigned to a variable - here, the value is not allowed to become less than 0. Other good uses of properties include notifying an event when a value is changed, or rebuilding cached values that might be based on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Length 65</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>int v;public static implicit operator int(Program o){return o.v;}
</code></pre>
<p>This feature is called an implicit cast. It's sort of like an extension method in that it is static code that operates on a specific class (see snippet 32). However, the implicit cast isn't used by calling it - it's used simply by treating a <code>Program</code> object as an integer (e.g. <code>int i=new Program()</code>). When you do this, the object will be silently converted into the type you're using it as, based on the code in the implicit cast. Best practice says to only do this when no information is lost as a result of the conversion.</p>

<div id="pu23" class="pu"><h1>Lua</h1>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>
<p>Lua is a dynamic, lightweight yet powerful, highly portable (pure Ansi C), fast and easy to learn scripting language.<br>
Initially designed to be a configuration language and to be embedded in applications to script them, it is also used as a glue between native libraries and to be a standalone language on its own.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>
<pre><code>;
</code></pre>
<p>You will nearly never see a semi-colon at the end of a Lua statement (unless that's the taste of the coder!), as they are totally optional and, most of the time, unnecessary. They can be used if you want to put two statements on the same line (even then it is optional: <code>a = 5 b = 3</code> is OK (but ugly!)) and to avoid some ambiguity: <code>a = f (f1 or f2)(x)</code> can be seen as <code>a = f; (f1 or f2)(x)</code> or as <code>a = f(f1 or f2)(x)</code> (call of <code>f</code> with a function argument returns a function which is called with <code>x</code> as argument).<br>
The semi-colon can be used as separator in table literals, too.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>
<pre><code>..
</code></pre>
<p>That's the string concatenation operator in Lua. If we concatenate a number, it is converted to string. For something else than strings or numbers, the <code>__concat</code> metamethod is called (more on this later).</p>
<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>
<pre><code>nil
</code></pre>
<p>is a special value, whose main property is to be different from any other value... It is generally used to represent the absence of a useful value, equivalent to <code>null</code> in some other languages.<br>
It is the only other value that is &quot;falsy&quot; (the first one being <code>false</code>, of course), any other value is coerced to <code>true</code> in a conditional expression.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>
<pre><code>f's'
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>f</code> is called with the literal string <code>&quot;s&quot;</code>. Note that literal strings can use single quotes or double quotes as delimiters.<br>
Here, as a function called with a single, string argument, we can omit the parentheses. That's syntax sugar for <code>f('s')</code>. This can be used for writing some nice DSL.<br>
This syntax shortcut can be used too when the single argument of the function is a table.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>
<pre><code>a={1}
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>a</code> is assigned with a table with one entry, <code>1</code>.<br>
Here, the table is treated as an array. We will see they can be also associative arrays (key / value).<br>
Table is a fundamental data structure in Lua, so it is optimized and efficient: it can have both an array part (with fast numerical index access) and a hash part for the associative side.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[\n]]
</code></pre>
<p>A literal string (long format) made of two characters: backslash and n. The <code>[[ ]]</code> notation allows to write multi-line strings with no escapes inside. Newlines are kept literally (except the one immediately after the opening bracket, if any: it is ignored for convenience of formatting).<br>
Lua allows nesting of long literal strings (eg. if you want to put one inside another) by putting a number of <code>=</code> sign between the two brackets. Of course, matching closing brackets must have the same number of equal signs.</p>
<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>
<pre><code>t={k=v}
</code></pre>
<p>A table defined as associative array: here, <code>k</code> is a shortcut for <code>['k']</code>, a string key (the latter annotation is useful for string keys that are not valid identifiers). <code>v</code> is a variable, its value will be the value of the entry.<br>
The key (index) can be any Lua value, except <code>nil</code>. The value can be any Lua value, but <code>nil</code> actually removes the entry.<br>
Access to entries can be done as <code>t.k</code> or as <code>t['k']</code>. The first form is valid only if the key is a valid identifier, otherwise we have to use the second form.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>
<pre><code>a,b=f(x)
</code></pre>
<p>A function can return several values (put them after the <code>return</code> keyword, separated by commas), and these values can be assigned at once to several variables.<br>
If the function provides more values than the number of left-hand variables, the extra values are dropped.<br>
If it doesn't provide enough values, the extra variables get <code>nil</code> as value.<br>
A common pattern in Lua is to return either a single value, or <code>nil</code> and an error message if something went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>
<pre><code>--[[ C ]]
</code></pre>
<p>A block comment. Line comments are marked with a double dash. Block comments extends this notation with a block of text (potentially multiline) marked between double brackets. Actually, they use a syntax similar to long literal strings, including the equal signs between the brackets, whose number allows to distinguish nested blocks. This allows to avoid conflicts with other block comments or long literal strings when commenting out a long block of code.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>
<pre><code>local v={}
</code></pre>
<p>Lua started its career as a configuration language, and is still useful as such. Because of this, its variables are global by default, ie. they are attached to the built-in <code>_ENV</code> variable and visible everywhere. That's also where we find the standard libraries, for example.<br>
Of course, this global environment is to be avoided for most usages, because of collision risks, encapsulation issues, and because a global variable is slower than a local one.<br>
Lua supports lexical scoping, we can define variables that are visible only within their scope, their chunk (from the declaration point to the end of the chunk) and the nested chunks.<br>
The statement above declares a local variable initialized to an empty table.<br>
For performance reason, a common practice is to bring global functions to the local scope, like <code>local print, find = print, string.find</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>
<pre><code>a,b,c=b,c,a
</code></pre>
<p>As seen, a function can return several values, which can be assigned in one go to several variables.<br>
It also works with several values (separated by commas) on the right hand side.<br>
The expression above cyclically permutes the values of a, b and c, ie. a takes the value of b which takes the value of c which is assigned the value of a. It is a variant of the <code>a, b = b, a</code> expression which swaps two values.</p>
<p><strong>Length 12</strong></p>
<pre><code>::L:: goto L
</code></pre>
<p>The programming world frown upon the usage of GoTo, but the Lua authors consider it is malevolent only in bad hands... They introduced it in Lua 5.2 to answer a frequently asked feature: adding a <code>continue</code> statement. The <code>goto</code> statement effectively allows to jump to the end of a loop, and also allows to break out of several nested loops. Note that Java, which has <code>goto</code> in its reserved words, doesn't implement it, but have named <code>break</code> allowing such feature...<br>
Here, <code>goto SomeName</code> jumps to a scoped label named... SomeName, which is defined by surrounding the name with double colons like <code>::SomeName::</code></p>
<p><strong>Length 13</strong></p>
<pre><code>(a or b){x=1}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function call with a table as argument. Lua allows the syntax sugar of omitting the parentheses around the argument if it is unique and it is a table, similar to the call with a string seen at length 4. It allows to create some nice DSLs...<br>
Here, we also see a logical expression between two functions: if <code>a</code> is defined, it is called with the argument. If it is not defined, ie. has the value <code>nil</code>, then that's <code>b</code> which is called (assuming it cannot be <code>nil</code>). This fallback syntax is idiomatic in Lua to provide default values to variables. It has the same function than the ternary operator of C-like languages (<code>a ? a : b</code>)<br>
Note that in Lua, logical operators are spelled out: <code>or and not</code> instead of C's <code>|| &amp;&amp; !</code>, slightly less readable for newbies.</p>
<p><strong>Length 14</strong></p>
<pre><code>_ENV={p=print}
</code></pre>
<p>Starting from Lua 5.2, local environment of a current function is exposed using variable <code>_ENV</code>. While its default value is <code>_G</code>, global environment, as any other variable, it can be assigned any value!<br />
Here, we change local environment, one from which free names are resolved, to table including single key-value pair with string key <code>p</code> and value being built-in function <code>print</code>. After this assignment, <code>p</code> will be the only resolvable name in current environment.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15</strong></p>
<pre><code>ffi.load'mylib'
</code></pre>
<p>While Lua have official implementation in ANSI C, others exist as well. One of most well-known ones is <a href="https://luajit.org/download.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LuaJIT</a>, in which this line would load C library called <code>mylib.so</code> on UNIX or <code>mylib.dll</code> on Windows and expose its functions directly to your Lua code. In addition to this, LuaJIT implements JIT-compilation for Lua code, greatly increasing its speed compared to official interpreter.<br />
However, LuaJIT's  last release was back in 2017 and it also implements Lua 5.1 API, making its usage now somewhat questionable. Newer JIT compiler for Lua is <a href="https://ravilang.github.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ravi</a>, that's based on LLVM and targets Lua 5.3 API. It also implements some language extensions.</p>
<p><strong>Length 16</strong></p>
<pre><code>function N(a)end
</code></pre>
<p>You can create global functions with the <code>function</code> keyword followed by a name.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>
<pre><code>N=function(a) end
</code></pre>
<p>The above snippet is syntactic sugar for this. <code>local function N()end</code> is sugar for <code>local N=function()end</code>. This is allowed because functions are first-class values.</p>
<p><strong>Length 18</strong></p>
<pre><code>(&quot;n=%d&quot;):format(3)
</code></pre>
<p>Wow, lots to introduce. This <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-string.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>format</code></a>s the string <code>n=%d</code>, replacing the <code>%d</code> with the number 3. The <code>:</code> denotes a method call, which is the same as calling <code>(&quot;n=%d&quot;).format(&quot;n=%d&quot;, 3)</code>. But wait, <code>&quot;n=%d&quot;</code> doesn't have the property <code>format</code>! Instead, since it isn't a table and doesn't have this property, Lua looks at its <em>metatable</em>, the global <code>string</code> table, and finds the <code>format</code> property there. Metatables are kind of like prototypes in Javascript. It then calls the <code>string.format</code> function with <code>&quot;n=%d&quot;</code> and <code>3</code> as its arguments, and returns <code>&quot;n=3&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Taken from <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44532/34718">this old answer of mine</a>, which was conveniently 100 bytes.</p>
<p>This program uses regular expressions on the input string to count the number of whitespace characters, then non-whitespace characters. It will then display the counts, and the sum total. This challenge had a source restriction, requiring the programs to have an equal number of whitespace and non-whitespace characters. Running this program with itself as input will print <code>50 + 50 = 100</code>.</p>
<p><code>re.sub</code> is the function to replace using a regex. <code>re.subn</code> does the same thing, but also returns the number of replacements (in addition to the string after replacement). This program also uses a format string with a tuple of parameters to print in the proper format.</p>

Alternatively, you could use <code>.encode(&quot;Rot13&quot;)</code> after every string (don't forget to use Rot13 on this, too.) According to <a href="https://breakingcode.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/quickpost-hiding-your-python-source-with-rot13/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a>, some alternate encodings are “base64″, “uuencode”, “zlib”, or “bz2″.</p>

<p>Now we define our own factorial function using recursion and the ternary if-else! As far as I know, this is as golfed as it gets in Python. It could also be written this way: <code>f=lambda n:n and f(n-1)*n or 1</code>, showcasing a couple Python's Boolean operators (and also done in 30 characters.)

<p>Finally, enough room to print some basic output! The space is not required here, because quotes and parentheses are also delimiters.

<p>This defines a square root function using Python's <code>lambda</code> syntax for a function literal. Function literals in Python can only contain expressions, not statements. This lambda could be assigned to a variable, passed to a function, or executed in-line with <code>(lambda x:x**.5)(9)</code>, which returns <code>3.0</code>.

<p>This is an example of Python's ternary if operator. This was added in Python 2.5 to discourage coders from manually implementing it with Boolean operations. Here, <code>1</code> is return if <code>x</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, otherwise <code>0</code> is returned.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This function returns a list of integers from <code>0</code> to the octal value <code>013</code>, which is <code>11</code> (exclusive), meaning that the list will be <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code>. The function takes up to three parameters similar to the <code>slice</code> function we reviewed earlier: <code>range(start, stop[, step])</code>. The difference is, with only one parameter the parameter represents the stopping value.</p>
<p>Note that Python 3.x has no equivalent. It's <code>range</code> is similar, but is actually the same as Python 2's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#xrange" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>xrange</code></a>, returning a generator object instead of a list.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>a,b = b,a
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple assignment. This is a simple but elegant feature, allowing you to assign multiple values at the same time. In the snippet provided, it swaps <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. What about the order of evaluation, you ask? All the expressions to the right of the assignment operator are evaluated before any of the assignments are made. This beats many languages that require an intermediate assignment to a temporary variable.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>#comment
</code></pre>
<p>You know what it is... Wait, you don't? You know, those things that let you type arbitrary text to describe a line of code, making it easier to understand? No? Oh, okay...</p>
<p><strong>Length 7:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>l[::-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Again assuming <code>l</code> is a list, this will return the list in reverse order. The third argument indicates step size. Since all three arguments can be negative values, a negative step size means iterating in reverse order. The empty first and second arguments show that we're iterating over the entire list.</p>
<p>We're getting to where we can start using some more interesting constructs!</p>
<p><strong>Length 6:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>l[-6:]
</code></pre>
<p>This is called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#slice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">slice</a> operation. If <code>l</code> is a list, this will return a new list containing the last six elements of <code>l</code> as a list. <code>-6</code> represents the starting index (6 from the end), and the colon means to continue until the ending index after it (which we left blank, so to the end.) If our list contained the numbers 1 through 10, this would return <code>[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>1&lt;x&lt;5
</code></pre>
<p>One of Python's awesome features is allowing you to chain comparison operators. In many other languages, this would be typed as <code>1 &lt; x &amp;&amp; x &lt; 5</code>. It gets even better when you consider multiple comparisons:  <code>1 &lt; x &lt; y &lt; 5</code> is perfectly valid!</p>
<p><strong>Length 4:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>0256
</code></pre>
<p>An integer with a leading zero is a literal octal value. This is a nice trick for code obfuscation as well. This returns the decimal value <code>174</code>. In Python 3.x, the octal value would be written as <code>0o256</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>`3`
</code></pre>
<p>Surrounding an expression in backticks is the same as using <code>repr()</code>, which returns the string representation of an object. The function attempts to return the string in such a way that when it is passed as an argument to the <code>eval</code> function, it will return the original object. It is <em>not</em> the same as using <code>str()</code>, though the results are sometimes the same. For this input, <code>'3'</code> is returned in both cases. This is a favorite of mine for code golf!</p>
<p><em>Works in Python 2 only!</em></p>
<p><strong>Length 2:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>[]

<p>An empty list.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>_
</code></pre>
<p>The underscore character is a much-used throwaway variable name. If you are using a Python shell (interactive interpreter), however, it holds the result of the last executed statement (and would return it again.) Also, according to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5893163/underscore-in-python/5893946#5893946">this thread</a>, it is also used for translation lookup in i18n.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong>: Python is a language similar to Java and C. It was built with a specific design philosophy (taken from &quot;<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 20 – The Zen of Python</a>&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
<li>Readability counts</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these, though semi-colons are allowed as a statement delimiter, they are usually omitted in favor of using multiple lines for readability. Also, line indentation is very important!</p>

</code></pre>
<p>It is a very short way to output truthy/falsey values if you are asked to determine if <code>$x</code> is even. (or <code>E</code> for error)</p>
<p>It golfs down a <code>switch</code> statement</p>
<pre><code>switch($x%2){0{1}1{0}2{'E'}}
</code></pre>
<p>It can index the array using modulo. So the basic algorithm is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>$x</code> is even, then <code>$x%2</code> is <code>0</code>, so first element in array is <code>1</code></li>
<li>If <code>$x</code> is odd, then <code>$x%2</code> is <code>1</code>, so first element in array is <code>0</code></li>
<li>Otherwise if <code>$x%2</code> errors, it shows <code>E</code></li>

<p>This combines several snippets below into a very powerful feature. Still using <code>%</code> as an alias for <code>foreach-object</code>, we use both of its position-0 positional parameters: <code>-memberName</code> which takes a string and will return the specified member for each object and can take wildcards provided they resolve to a non-ambiguous name (<code>String</code>'s <code>toCharArray</code> in this example); and <code>-process</code> which applies a script-block to each object (<code>{$_}</code> in the example).</p>
<p>The example above is a way to iterate through each character in a string and implicitly output it.</p>

<h3>Length 13 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1,1|select -u
</code></pre>
<p>Parameters in PowerShell can both be <em>positional</em> and <em>expanded</em>. Positional meaning if the parameter flag isn't explicitly specified, it can be inferred. For example, <code>Get-Random 10</code> is the same as <code>Get-Random -Maximum 10</code>, because the <code>-Maximum</code> parameter is positional.</p>
<p>Here, we're using the expandable property of parameters. Since <code>-Unique</code> is the only parameter to <code>Select-Object</code> that starts with <code>-u</code>, we don't need to spell out the entirety of the parameter. Both of these features saves tons of bytes.</p>
<p>The output of this snippet, which feeds an <code>[int]</code>-array into the <code>Select-Object</code> cmdlet is <code>1</code>, as an <code>[int]</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 12 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>0xff*2KB-2e6
</code></pre>
<p>PowerShell has some <s>weird</s> special operators that allow large numbers to be written in small number of characters.</p>
<p>The <code>0x</code> unary operator converts characters from hexadecimal to decimal. For example, <code>0xff --&gt; 255</code> or <code>0xbeef --&gt; 48879</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>KB</code> (and <code>MB</code>, <code>GB</code>, <code>TB</code>, and 'PB') unary operators take input on the left and multiply it by <code>1024</code>, <code>1048576</code>, <code>1073741824</code>, <code>1099511627776</code>, or <code>1125899906842624</code>, respectively. For example, instead of <code>[int]::MaxValue</code>, or <code>2147483647</code>, you can write <code>2GB-1</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>e</code> (exponentiation) binary operator basically takes the input on the left and tacks on (the input on the right) number of zeros. For example, <code>2e6 --&gt; 2000000</code>.</p>
<p>The output of this snippet as written is <code>-1477760</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 11 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a=($b=1)+1
</code></pre>
<p>In PowerShell, it's very important to remember that you're dealing with objects on a pipeline. This can be manipulated in several ways, and the above shows the concept of encapsulation. Commands placed in parentheses are executed first (as you'd expect), but the <em>output</em> of the command is left on the pipeline to be picked up later. Here, we're assigning <code>$b</code> to be <code>1</code>, and then assigning <code>$a</code> to be <code>$b+1</code>. This snippet is equivalent to <code>$b=1;$a=$b+1</code>, and shows an easy way to golf bytes anytime you're doing an assignment.</p>
<p>The implications here go beyond just that, however, since it's the PowerShell pipeline and so we're dealing with objects. This means that complex object creations can have nested function or procedure calls, for example calling a constructor and immediately calling a method on the resultant object, and then immediately calling a property on the result. Something like <code>(((New-Object foo).bar()).GetBaz()).baz</code> is perfectly legitimate. In some cases, you don't even need to assign the object to a variable.</p>
<p>Additionally, since anything left on the pipeline is implicitly printed after execution, this means you can accumulate data on the pipeline and print for essentially free. For an easy example, a simple accumulator from 1 to 10 (prints <code>1</code>, then <code>3</code>, then <code>6</code> ...) can be <code>1..10|%{($a+=$_)}</code> vs <code>1..10|%{$a+=$_;$a}</code>, saving a byte, but can save significantly more in other situations. Since we're talking about output, this is a good time to bring up that nearly every output to the console/shell in PowerShell includes a newline (technically <code>\r\n</code> because it's Windows), so if the challenge requires separators we get that for free, too.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 10 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a,$b=1..9
</code></pre>
<p>PowerShell has the capability to do multiple assignment. In the above snippet, <code>$a</code> will be <code>1</code>, an int, while <code>$b</code> will be <code>(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)</code>, an int-array. This has the ability to save lots of bytes if you're looking for particular items -- for example, <code>$a,$b=-split$somestring</code> will split <code>$somestring</code> on whitespace, store the first word in <code>$a</code> and the rest in <code>$b</code>. Very useful if you're looping through a string, for example, or re-manipulating the rest of the string in some fashion.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 9 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>(4,9)[$a]
</code></pre>
<p>PowerShell has very loose type casting. <em>Very</em> loose. We can thus abuse this typecasting to transform array-indexing (as the above) into an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement. For this snippet, if <code>$a</code> will somehow evaluate to a truthy value (a non-zero number, a non-empty string, any other non-<code>$null</code> variable, etc.), the Boolean result will be typecast to a <code>1</code> and so the <code>9</code> will be selected. Conversely, if <code>$a</code> evaluates falsey, the <code>4</code> will be selected. This is PowerShell's <code>x?y:z</code> style ternary if, and is significantly shorter than the equivalent <code>if($a){9}else{4}</code>. It's rare for an actual <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement to show up in PowerShell golfing.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 8 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$c+=++$i
</code></pre>
<p>A simple example showing a couple basic operations. PowerShell has both pre- and post- increment and decrement operators (<code>++</code> and <code>--</code>), and they function pretty much like you'd expect, <em>except</em> when it comes to uninitialized variables. Running the above snippet in a brand-new shell will result in <code>++$i</code> evaluating first as <code>$null + 1 = 1</code> and storing in <code>$i</code>, then adding that result to <code>$c</code> (also <code>$null</code>), which makes <code>$c</code> equal to <code>1</code> as well. Flip the pre-increment to be a post-increment and you get a different result, with <code>$c = 0</code> and <code>$i = 1</code>, <em>but</em> with <code>$c</code> cast as an <code>Int32</code>. This null-arithmetic is a sneaky way of shaving a couple bytes here or there, especially when it comes to not needing to check if a variable already is initialized.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>,'a'*$b
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, so that's a thing. No, really. It's the PowerShell <em>comma operator</em> and it's used to create arrays. As an inline (binary) operator, it creates multi-element arrays, as in <code>$myArray = 1,2,3</code>. As a unary operator, it creates an array with one member, as in <code>$myArray = ,1</code>. In both instances <code>$myArray.GetType()</code> will tell us that it's a <code>System.Array</code> object. Here, we're coupling this with operator overloading (multiplication, specifically) to create an array of length <code>$b</code> with each element equal to <code>'a'</code> -- that is, we can create and pre-populate an array in one go. It's important to note that the array element is evaluated <em>once</em> and then multiplied, so you <em>can't</em> do something fancy like <code>$a=1;$b=5;,($a++)*$b</code> and expect an array <code>1,2,3,4,5</code>. Bummer.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 6 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a-gt2
</code></pre>
<p>OK, pretty simplistic, but this is a continuation of the below concepts. In addition to the usual <code>+-*/</code> operator overloading, PowerShell <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847759.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>comparison</em> operators</a> (<code>-le -eq -gt</code> etc.) are overloaded, too. As are most other &quot;basic&quot; operators.</p>
<p>Let's suppose that <code>$a=3</code>, an int. Then, the above snippet will result in <code>$TRUE</code> as it's comparing &quot;is 3 greater than 2?&quot; So far, so standard. However, let's take <code>$a=(0,1,2,3,4,5)</code> an array of int's from 0 to 5. In this case, the above snippet will result in an array <code>(3,4,5)</code> - that is, it constructed a new array and populated it with all elements of <code>$a</code> that are individually greater than <code>2</code>. Have a constructed array already and want to know how many elements are equal to 0? Try <code>($a-eq0).Count</code>. Want the biggest element in the array that's smaller than a certain value? How about <code>($a-lt4|sort)[-1]</code> (using our &quot;last element&quot; trick from Snippet 4).</p>
<p>This sort of operator overloading continues to other objects, too, not just arrays and ints. <code>$StringA -gt $StringB</code> will categorize the two strings alphabetically. <code>$CharA -gt $CharB</code> calculates based on their ASCII value. And on and on and on. Pretty much any object in PowerShell can be compared like this.</p>
<p>As a bonus, in most cases, if the right-hand operand can be parsed appropriately, you can mix and match types like you can with normal arithmetic operators. As an example, <code>$DateA -lt &quot;2015/12/17&quot;</code> will implicitly parse the right-hand string into a .NET <code>datetime</code> object to calculate comparison.</p>
<p>Combined, the Length 5 and Length 6 snippets allow PowerShell codegolf answers to be <em>very</em> loose with type-casting, which cuts out a tremendous amount of bytes.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$a+$b
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;What, really? The <em>plus-sign</em> is what you're showcasing? Phaw!&quot; OK, OK, put down your torches and pitchforks, and hear me out. I'm showcasing operator overloading. &quot;Well, so what, plenty of other languages have that! Plus, you showed that for your Length-1 Snippet!&quot; Yeah, but that needs to also be coupled with PowerShell's powerful implicit casting and implicit parsing.</p>
<p>Operations like the above snippet in PowerShell take on the characteristics of the left-hand side operand. Suppose <code>$a='123'</code> and <code>$b=4</code>, with the first as a string and the second as an int. With the above snippet, the result will be <code>1234</code> as a string. Flip the order <code>$b+$a</code> and PowerShell will implicitly parse the string object to turn it into an int, and the result will be <code>127</code> as an int.</p>
<p>While this is powerful, and allows you to abuse plenty of different operators for nefarious codegolf purposes, it has the <s>quirk</s> feature that operators are not commutative. In other words, <code>($a+$b) -eq ($b+$a)</code> will return <code>False</code> in <em>lots</em> of cases.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>A secret weapon used when indexing arrays or strings or the like to retrieve &quot;the last element.&quot; We don't even need to know the length of the array. Want the second-to-last element? Use <code>[-2]</code> instead. And so on.</p>
<p>One example where this comes in handy is in finding the maximal of a list of numbers. Suppose we previously stored them in <code>$x</code>. PowerShell already has an alias for <code>Sort-Object</code> as <code>sort</code>, thus, we can do <code>($x|sort)[-1]</code> to pull out the maximal item from <code>$x</code>, and we don't even care or know how many items are in <code>$x</code>, and it's significantly shorter than the &quot;regular&quot; method of <code>($x|measure -maximum).Maximum</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>iex
</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>iex</code> is an alias for <code>Invoke-Expresssion</code>, and is similar to an <code>eval()</code> style statement. However, it has implications for codegolf in that it can take parameters <em>or</em> pipeline input (because remember, the pipeline hands off objects, not text).</p>
<p>As a simple example, suppose I need to sum the numbers from 1 to 10. I could write <code>1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10</code>, but at 20 bytes that's pretty lengthy. I know I can get a range of numbers using the <code>..</code> range operator, such as <code>1..10</code>, but now I essentially have an array of integers. I can concatenate them together with the <code>join</code> operator, like so <code>1..10-join'+'</code>, and now I have a string that can be fed into <code>iex</code> as <code>1..10-join'+'|iex</code>, for 17 bytes. This simple example shows how very complex commands can be dynamically constructed rather than hardcoded, but still be executed as if they were coded directly, and can significantly cut down on byte-count.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$_
</code></pre>
<p>This was already introduced below in the Length-1 snippet, but it's important enough to reiterate here. Another strong suit that gives PowerShell advantages in codegolfing is the concept of <em>automatic variables</em>. That is, variables that are implicitly created in the background by the system. Here, the <code>$_</code> variable stands for &quot;the current object in the pipeline.&quot; Essentially, it's a variable that is a dynamic placeholder for whatever object we're currently manipulating.</p>
<p>In the example loop <code>1..1e4|%{$_%5}</code>, the <code>$_</code> variable first holds the integer <code>1</code>, then <code>2</code>, then <code>3</code>, etc. The power is more evident when dealing with a collection of different objects - <code>$_</code> could be a string, an int, a custom PSObject holding the entire Windows System Event Log, a TCP/IP socket object, etc., all dynamically typed as the situation changes.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>%
</code></pre>
<p>The other answer used a pipe <code>|</code> for the Length-1 snippet, and that's probably the most important 1-symbol snippet for 99% of use cases, but the <code>%</code> is functionally way more powerful for codegolf purposes, and introduces two important concepts.</p>
<p>The first is one of PowerShell's hidden codegolf weapons, aliasing, which significantly cuts down code length. Here, the <code>%</code> character is a standard alias for <code>ForEach-Object</code>, and allows us to create loops with very little code overhead.</p>
<p>The second is operator overloading. In PowerShell, as in other languages, the <code>%</code> operator stands for modulo -- <code>3%2</code> will return <code>1</code> as an example. However, thanks to a strongly/weakly typed system (more on that later), and strong syntax requirements, the same character serves double-duty.</p>
<p>For example, <code>1..1e4|%{$_%5}</code> is a loop that will generate and output a <code>123401234012340...</code> string that's 10,000 characters long (with newlines in between, more on that later).</p>
<p>I've already rambled <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62295/42963">at length</a> about the differences between <code>ForEach</code> and <code>ForEach-Object</code>, so I won't redo that here.</p>

<p>Windows PowerShell had its origins over a dozen years ago (and actually just had its 9-year release anniversary; the original release was 14/Nov/2006) as Monad and the Microsoft Shell. I highly recommend reading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151023032759/http://blogs.msdn.com:80/b/powershell/archive/2007/03/19/monad-manifesto-the-origin-of-windows-powershell.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Monad Manifesto</a>, originally published in <em>August of 2002</em>, for an amazing insight into the development process and reasoning behind naming conventions and features that developed to make PowerShell what it is today.</p>

<div id="pu27" class="pu"><h1>ARM Thumb-2</h1>
<p><sup><em>Also applies to <a href="https://github.com/easyaspi314/thumbgolf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ThumbGolf</a>, a direct superset of Thumb-2.</em></sup></p>
<p>ARM Thumb-2 is a rather quirky RISC instruction set. It is a 32-bit architecture, but unlike most RISC instruction sets, it uses a mix of 16-bit and 32-bit instructions.</p>
<p>Thumb was originally a 16-bit only subset of the 32-bit ARM instruction set, created in 1998 with the ARM7TDMI. It was designed for embedded devices which either had a 16-bit memory bus or required more code density, and it was pretty impractical otherwise.</p>
<p>In 2003, with the release of the ARM1156T2, this was expanded to a whole new instruction set, named Thumb-2. Combining flexible 32-bit instructions with the existing 16-bit instructions, Thumb-2 was a faster, smaller, and more polished replacement for the old 32-bit ARM instruction set.</p>
<p>ARM is best known for its powerful addressing modes, barrel shifter, <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0489/c/arm-and-thumb-instructions/multiply-instructions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Absolutely Ridiculous Multiplier</a>, load/store multiple, and conditional execution.</p>
<p>Small factoid: Thumb was a key factor in the Game Boy Advance's design. It significantly lowered the cost of Game Paks thanks to both the code density and the cheap memory bus.</p>

<p><code>lsls</code> and <code>lsrs</code> are (likely) the most useful arithmetic instructions out of the original 16-bit instruction set. Many masking operations can be done in half the size with a simple shift right and testing the flags.</p>
<p>This tests if the low bit is set. You can also use this for bitmasks, as <code>lsrs</code> and <code>lsls</code> also set the zero flag.</p>

<p>This sets <code>r0</code> to <code>0</code> if it was nonzero, or <code>1</code> if it was zero.</p>
<p>In C terms, it is <code>r0 = !r0</code>.</p>

<div id="pu28" class="pu"><h1>Scala</h1>
<p>Scala is a JVM-based, statically-typed (mostly), hybrid functional/object-oriented language, with type inference, higher kinded types, and generics.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong>: Scala started with the man behind Java generics and a lot of the Java compiler, Martin Odersky.</p>
<h2>1</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>;</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>There isn't much need for semicolons in Scala (unlike its cousin, Java), but they can still be found in some places, such as <code>for</code> statements (also known as &quot;<code>for</code> comprehensions&quot;). For example:</p>
<pre><code>for (i &lt;- 0 to 10;
     a &lt;- 0 to 10
) yield (i, a)
</code></pre>
<p>Will return a list going something like (0, 0), (0, 1)... (1, 9), (2, 0)... (10, 10).</p>
<h2>2</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>()</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Scala's <code>Unit</code> type has only one value: <code>()</code>. Used like Java or C's <code>void</code>. Don't be fooled, though: it's not an empty tuple!
This type is mostly returned from functions with side effects, to distinguish them from the purely functional ones. In Scala, <em>every</em> function <em>must</em> return a value. If they don't, they implicitly return <code>()</code>.</p>
<h2>3</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>???</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>An operator which just throws NotImplementedError. Luckily, thanks to Scala's powerful type system, it can be put in any unimplemented function and still be typesafe:</p>
<pre><code>def notImplemented: Int = ???
def foo: String = ???
</code></pre>
<p>One of the best parts of Scala is that there's very little baked-in as compiler magic, and you can write most of the builtins yourself. Operators are simply functions with names that contain symbols - <code>???</code> itself can be defined as:</p>
<pre><code>def ???: Nothing = throw new NotImplementedError(&quot;an implementation is missing&quot;);
</code></pre>
<h2>4</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>None</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>While Scala does have <code>null</code> as part of the language (as an unfortunate holdover from Java), it also has a pre-made option type, called <code>Option[T]</code>. If an optional value isn't there, its value is <code>None</code>. If a value is optional, make it an <code>Option</code>, and you won't ever have a <code>NullPointerException</code>. You can also implement Option yourself, like so:</p>
<pre><code>sealed trait Option[+T]
case class Some[T](value: T) extends Option[T]
case object None extends Option[Nothing]
</code></pre>
<h2>5</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>(1,2)</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>A 2-tuple (a pair) of integers, 1 and 2. Especially useful for returning multiple values from functions, as well as pattern matching. Observe:</p>
<pre><code>def printPoint(p: (Int, Int)) = p match {
    case (x, y) =&gt; println(&quot;X coordinate: &quot; + x + &quot;, Y coordinate: &quot; + y)
}
printPoint((1,2))
// prints &quot;X coordinate: 1, Y coordinate: 2&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>6</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>()=&gt;()</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>An anonymous function. As a functional language, Scala has first-class language support for anonymous functions. To dissect this snippet, it's a function which:</p>
<p><code>()</code> - Takes no parameters,</p>
<p><code>=&gt;</code> - And returns...</p>
<p><code>()</code> - Unit!</p>
<h2>7</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>s&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>The empty string... with a twist. If you begin and end a string with triple-quotes, you can include unescaped characters inside. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;\n&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Also, a string beginning with <code>s</code> can have interpolated values in it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>val num = 10    
val str = s&quot;There are $num nums&quot;
// str == &quot;There are 10 nums&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It gets better though: with braces, you can put expressions inside!</p>
<pre><code>val str = s&quot;2 + 2 == ${2 + 2}.&quot;
// str == &quot;2 + 2 == 4.&quot;
</code></pre>

<h3>Snippet</h3>
<p><code>Future{}</code></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p><strong>Futures</strong> are things that will happen or be computed... sometime later. Scala has a lot of different models of concurrency that are each useful in their own way (like the Akka framework), and <code>Future</code>s are one of them. <code>Future{}</code> computes <code>()</code>. Pretty useless, but if I have something really expensive to do, like compute 2 + 2 and multiply that by 5, they're pretty handy:</p>
<pre><code>Future {2 + 2} map {_ * 5)
</code></pre>
<p>They're also great for I/O.
Admittedly, you have to do a couple of imports for this, but they're in the standard library.</p>
<h2>10</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>type N=Int
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>This is a type variable called <code>N</code>, which refers to the type <code>Int</code>. You could now write:</p>
<pre><code>val num: N = 1
</code></pre>
<p>And it would work.</p>
<p>Addendum: I said type &quot;variable&quot;, but these can't vary during runtime. You can use these for some nifty type-level programming like the Heterogeneous List, or HList, which is a List that contain several different types of elements while still being typesafe. If you're interested, watch Daniel Spiewak's &quot;High Wizardry in the Land of Scala&quot;: <a href="http://vimeo.com/28793245" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://vimeo.com/28793245</a>.</p>

<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>implicit val a=1 
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Have you ever used a heavyweight dependency injection framework like Guice or Spring? If so, you know that dependency injection is (in essence) supplying objects with their dependencies at construction, so that they can stay loosely coupled. The issue with doing this the easy way is that constructor signatures quickly grow out of control when you start to build large dependency graphs. To fix that, you bring in a DI framework, and soon after, your project has 50k lines of XML. :-(</p>
<p>Now for a seemingly unrelated question: have you ever needed to call a series of functions, all sharing a few parameters? Has that ever become so cluttered that you added an extra class, just to put the parameters in one place?</p>
<p><strong>Implicits</strong> give you a way to inject a value of a particular type in a particular scope into a function call. This way, functions can ask for a value without you needing to explicitly provide it. It's filled in automatically! One of the best parts, and the reason this relates to DI, is that constructors also work with implicits. You can create huge parameter lists in your constructors to keep them loosely coupled, but users of your classes will never have to supply all of the parameters manually (but they can, if they want).</p>
<p>This particular snippet creates an implicit value of type <code>Int</code> in the current scope, with the value of <code>1</code>. If any function calls require an implicit <code>Int</code>, they'll automatically be fed <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>17</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-scala prettyprint-override"><code>({type I[T]=T})#I
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>This is a type lambda (in this case acting like an identity function for types). It's a combination of a type member (mentioned above) (<code>type I[T]</code> declares a type constructor <code>I</code> taking a type parameter <code>T</code> ), a structural type (everything between the braces denotes a type), and a type projection (<code>#I</code> accesses the member <code>I</code> of the structural type in braces).</p>
<p>In Scala 3, this can be expressed much more nicely as <code>[T] =&gt;&gt; T</code>.</p>
<h2>18</h2>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-scala prettyprint-override"><code>list.reduce(_ ^ _)
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Underscores have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/8000903">various uses</a> in Scala. Here, we can use them to define a trivial function more concisely. The <code>_ ^ _</code> is really shorthand for <code>(a, b) =&gt; a ^ b</code>.</p>
<p>The snippet reduces a list of what may be integers by XOR-ing them. <code>reduce</code> is just one of the many useful methods in the standard library. There are many others, such as <code>map</code>, <code>heads</code>, <code>distinct</code>, <code>groupBy</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu29" class="pu"><h1>dotcomma</h1>
<p>Dotcomma is a simple esolang I made, which uses only 4 instructions and <s>is not Turing complete</s> is now Turing complete, due to the addition of a queue for storage.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid:</strong></p>
<p>With only the instructions <code>[.,]</code>, the <code>.</code> and <code>,</code> operators are heavily overloaded. For example, <code>,</code> can take input and output, manage the queue, test the number of times a code block was evaluated, and conditionally evaluate a code block. Which of these occur is decided by what characters precede and follow an operator.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2 snippet:</strong></p>
<p>All dotcomma programs are wrapped in code blocks (<code>[]</code>), so a length 1 snippet is impossible.</p>
<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>
<p>This program does nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[.]
</code></pre>
<p>This program sets its return value to 1. All operators and blocks have a return value, which can be used by other operators and blocks to nest expressions, create loops, or manage the programs's structure. If the <code>.</code> operator is preceded by <code>[</code>, it's return value is <code>1</code>. If followed by a <code>]</code>, it uses its return value as the block's return value.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[,]
</code></pre>
<p>This program would previously take a value from input, and output it. The return value of the <code>,</code> operator would have been taken from input when preceded by <code>[</code>, and outputted if followed by <code>]</code>.</p>
<p>In &quot;modern&quot; dotcomma, this will take a value from the queue, and place it at the end of the queue. For example, given the input <code>6 7 8</code> (input is placed on the queue by default), this program would output <code>7 8 6</code> (final value of the queue is used as output by default).</p>
<p>Like the <code>.</code> operator, <code>,</code> will use its return value as a block's return value if followed by <code>]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[.,]
</code></pre>
<p>This program will output <code>1</code>. As with the second snippet, the <code>.</code>'s return value is set to <code>1</code>. However, because the <code>,</code> operator is preceded by an operator, it will use that operator's return value instead of taking a value from the queue.</p>
<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[,]]
</code></pre>
<p>This program will take a value from the queue, and place it back on the queue. However, it will have a return value of 0. This is because the <code>,</code> is wrapped in a nested block, and blocks default to a return value of 0 if an operator does not explicitly define one.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[,].]
</code></pre>
<p>This program does the exact same thing as <code>[,]</code>. The <code>.</code> operator, if preceded by <code>]</code>, will set its return value to the sum of the return values of all previous un-separated blocks, which is only one in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[].[],.]
</code></pre>
<p>This will return the -1. The first empty block's return value will be read by <code>.</code>, which returns 0. As a result, the next block will be skipped (a loop that runs 0 times). Because the block preceding the <code>,</code> was never run, its return value will be -1.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[[,.][,.].]
</code></pre>
<p>This program uses the <code>.</code> operator's addition capabilities to take the sum of two inputs and use it as the program's exit code. Adding a <code>.</code> to the end of the <code>,</code> operators will prevent them from outputting, as they are no longer followed by <code>]</code>.</p>

<div id="pu30" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/MATL" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MATL</a></h1>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>MATL is a <strong>stack-oriented</strong> language based on MATLAB and suitable for code golf. Many functions are similar to those of MATLAB, sometimes with extended funcionality.</p>
<p>To simplify stack handling there are <strong>clipboards</strong>, similar to variables in other languages. An interesting feature is an automatic clipboard that holds the inputs of recent function calls. This often avoids the need to manually copy.</p>
<p>There are different types of functions. Most are <strong>normal functions</strong>, which perform operations on inputs and produce outputs. Other types are stack-handling functions, for duplicating, deleting or moving elements in the stack; and clipboard functions, for copying and pasting elements from the clipboards.</p>
<h3>Length 1: sum of elements in an array</h3>
<p>The program (<a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=cw&amp;input=WzEgMiAzIDQ7IDUgNiA3IDg7IDkgMTAgMTEgMTJd" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it online!</a>)</p>
<pre><code>s
</code></pre>
<p>computes the sum of an array provided as input and displays it. This serves to illustrate several things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong> can be <strong>implicit</strong>: if a function needs an input that is not present in the stack, it is automatically taken. The explicit form would be <code>is</code>, where <code>i</code> takes the input.</li>
<li>The stack contents are <strong>implicitly displayed</strong> at the end of the program, by default.</li>
<li>MATL, like MATLAB, has many operations that automatically operate on the contents of an array. Using terminology of other languages, <code>s</code> folds the addition operation over the array.</li>
<li>If the input to <code>s</code> is multidimensional, this function performs the sum along the first non-singleton dimension, as in MATLAB. For example, if the input is a 3×4 array (use <code>;</code> as row separator), the output will be a 1×4 row array (sum along first dimension). If the input is a 1×4 row array, the result will be a 1×1 array (sum along second dimension), which is the same as a number.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Length 2: sum along columns</h3>
<p>So what if we want the sum of each column, even if the input happens to be a row array? The following code (<a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=WHM&amp;input=WzEgMiAzXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it online!</a>) does that:</p>
<pre><code>Xs
</code></pre>
<p>These <strong>two characters</strong> together are the name of a single function, which in this case is &quot;sum along the first dimension&quot;. Functions are always named by either one or two characters, and in the latter case the first character is always <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> or <code>Z</code>.</p>
<p>Another form of forcing the sum to operate along the fixed dimension would be to use the <code>s</code> function with two inputs, and specify the desired dimension as second input (see length-3 snippet).</p>
<h3>Length 3: ternary range</h3>
<pre><code>3$:
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=MyQ6&amp;input=NQoyCjEy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>Many functions can take a variable number of inputs or outputs. Each function has a default number of inputs and outputs, or arity. These default can be modified by means of <strong>meta-functions</strong>. The meta-function <code>$</code> specifies the number of inputs (or even their position in the stack) of the following normal function.</p>
<p>The function <code>:</code> (range) by default takes one input <code>n</code>, and produces its unary range. With three inputs, say <code>i</code>, <code>s</code> and <code>f</code>, it produces an array formed by numbers <code>i, i+s, i+2*s</code>, ... up to the largest integer not exceeding <code>f</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 4: multiplication table</h3>
<p>The code (<a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=OnQhKg&amp;input=MTA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it online!</a>)</p>
<pre><code>:t!*
</code></pre>
<p>produces an <code>n</code>×<code>n</code> multiplicaton table, where <code>n</code> is an input number.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:</code> by default it takes 1 input, and produces the row array <code>[1,2,...,n]</code>.</li>
<li><code>t</code> is a <strong>stack-handling function</strong>. It also takes 1 input by default, and simply duplicates it. Other stack-handling functions are <code>w</code> (swap elements) and <code>b</code> (&quot;bubble up&quot; and element).</li>
<li><code>!</code> is transposition, so the row array at the top of the stack becomes a column array <code>[1;2;...;n]</code>.</li>
<li><code>*</code> corresponds to multiplication. By default it takes two inputs. Like most arithmetic operators, it works <strong>element-wise</strong> with <strong>broadcast</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter means that repetition is implicitly applied along singleton dimensions if needed. In this case, the two arrays have non-matching dimensions <code>1</code>×<code>n</code> and <code>n</code>×<code>1</code>. Thus the first array is implicitly replicated <code>n</code> times along the first dimension, and the second along the first dimension, so that they can be multiplied element-by-element. This produces all &quot;combinations&quot; (in the sense of Cartesian product) of the operation.</p>
<p>The result is a 2D numeric array. Numeric arrays are displayed as numbers separated by spaces with vertical alignment.</p>
<h3>Length 5: display &quot;all&quot; even numbers</h3>
<pre><code>`@EDT
</code></pre>
<p>This uses an <strong>infinite loop</strong>, specifically a &quot;do...while&quot; loop in which the loop condition is always true. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=YEBFRFQ&amp;input=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a> (but kill it immediately).</p>
<p>A &quot;do...while&quot; loop begins with <code>`</code> and ends with <code>]</code>. &quot;End&quot; statements <code>]</code> at the end of the program can be omitted, because the loop is <strong>implicitly closed</strong> in that case.</p>
<p>In a &quot;do...while&quot; loop, when the (possibly implicit) statement <code>]</code> is reached the top of the stack is consumed, and if it's truthy the code proceeds with the next iteration. An array is <strong>truthy</strong> if and only if it is <strong>non-empty</strong> and <strong>all</strong> its elements have <strong>nonzero</strong> real part. In this case a <code>T</code> literal (<code>true</code>, corresponding to a logical <code>1</code>) is pushed at the end of each iterartion, so the loop goes on forever.</p>
<p>The body of the loop pushes the iteration index with <code>@</code>. Note that iteration indices start at <code>1</code>. Then <code>E</code> doubles that number, and <code>D</code> displays it. In this case we cannot rely on implicit display at the end of the program, because this program never ends.</p>
<h3>Length 6: Separate primes from non-primes</h3>
<pre><code>tZp2#)
</code></pre>
<p>This code accepts as input an array of positive integers, and produces two arrays: one with the primes contained in the input, and one with the non-primes. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=dFpwMiMp&amp;input=WzEgMiAzIDQgNSA2IDcgOCA5IDEwXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>The code is based on <strong>logical indexing</strong>, which means using an array of type <code>logical</code> as an index. This works as in MATLAB:  <code>true</code> values in the index specify which entries to use. So for an array <code>[10 20 30 40]</code>, the index <code>[false true false true]</code> refers to the subarray formed by the second and fourth entries, that is, <code>[20 40]</code>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to only pick the primes from the input, the code would be <code>tZp)</code>: duplicate the input (<code>t</code>), check for each entry if it's a prime (<code>Zp</code>), and then use the second array as an index into the first (<code>)</code>).</p>
<p><code>)</code> is one of the several <strong>indexing functions</strong> in MATL. Specifically, it does <strong>reference indexing</strong>, which means extracting elements from an array. (This contrasts with assignment indexing, whereby specified positions of an array are written with new values). The <code>)</code> function, like others used for reference indexing, has a two-output version, which produces the indexed array and the <strong>&quot;complementary&quot; array</strong>, corresponding to the entries not selected by the index. The meta-function <code>#</code> specifies the number of outputs of the following normal function. So in this case <code>2#)</code> produces the primes and then the non-primes in separate arrays.</p>
<h3>Length 7: Separate digits from non-digit characters</h3>
<pre><code>t4Y2m&amp;)
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet is similar to that with length 6, but serves to illustrate two new aspects: predefined literals and meta function <code>&amp;</code>. The code takes a string and separates it into two strings: one formed by the digits and one with the non-digits, maintainig the order they have in the input. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=dDRZMm0mKQ&amp;input=J1RoaXMgc3RyMW5nIGMwbnRhaW5zIDMgZGlnaXRzJw" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p><code>Y2</code> is one of several functions that produce <strong>predefined literals</strong> depending on its numeric input. In this case, <code>4Y2</code> gives the string <code>'0123456789'</code>. Function <code>m</code> takes two inputs by default, and outputs a logical array that contains <code>true</code> for elements of the first input that are present in the second. This is then used as logical index into the original string, which was duplicated (<code>t</code>) at the beginning.</p>
<p><code>2#)</code> would then produce a substring with the digits and then a substring with the remaining characters. But <code>&amp;)</code> can be used instead.</p>
<p>Most functions allow an <strong>alternative</strong> or <strong>secondary default</strong> input/output configuration. <strong>Meta-function <code>&amp;</code></strong> is used for this purpose. For <code>)</code>, using <code>&amp;</code> corresponds to selecting two outputs, so <code>&amp;)</code> is equivalent to <code>2#)</code>. Thus the code produces the stated result.</p>
<p>The meaning of <code>&amp;</code> is function-specific. For example, for <code>:</code> it affects the number of inputs. A way to see this is to display the <strong>function's help</strong> using option <code>-h</code> of the compiler:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; matl -h :
:   vector of equally spaced values
    1--3 (1 / 2);  1
    colon (with three inputs x, y, z produces x:y:z; with two inputs 
    x, y produces x:y). If one input: produces 1:x 
</code></pre>
<p>The line <code>1--3 (1 / 2);  1</code> describes the possible numbers of inputs and outputs. This function takes a variable number of inputs from <code>1</code> to <code>3</code>, and produces <code>1</code> output. The default number of inputs is <code>1</code>, and the effect of <code>&amp;</code> is to change that to <code>2</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 8: filter square-free numbers</h3>
<p>The code</p>
<pre><code>&quot;@YfdA?@
</code></pre>
<p>takes an array of integers and outputs those integers that are square-free. A number is square-free if it can't be divided by a perfect square other than 1. Equivalently, in the prime factor decomposition of a square-free number no prime appears more than once. This code serves to illustrate some <strong>control flow</strong> structures, namely <code>for</code> loops and <code>if</code> branches. <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=IkBZZmRBP0A&amp;input=WzEwIDIwIDMwIDQwIDUwIDYwXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>Statement <code>&quot;</code> begins a <strong>for-each loop</strong>: it takes an array as input and iterates over its columns. Within the loop, <code>@</code> pushes the current iteration variable, that is, each column of array. In the present case the input is a row array, so each column is just one number. <code>Yf</code> takes that number and pushes its prime factors. <code>d</code> computes the differences between consecutive elements, so a square-free number will not produce any <code>0</code>. <code>A</code> with a vector as input gives <code>true</code> if all the elements are nonzero. So the output of <code>A</code> tells if the current number is square-free or not.</p>
<p>Following is an <strong>if branch</strong>: <code>?</code> takes an input and if truthy executes the next statements. In this case there is only one statement, <code>@</code>, which pushes the current number (which was found to be square-free).</p>
<p>Control flow structures are normally ended by <code>]</code>. In this case, the two <code>]</code> statements are implicit at the end (as in the length-5 snippet). Using the compiler with the <code>-e</code> option shows the code including the implicit statements, as well as <strong>automatic comments</strong>, which may be useful as a starting point for an explanation of the code, with <strong>indentation</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; matl -e &quot;@YfdA?@

&quot;          % for
  @        % for loop variable
  Yf       % prime factors
  d        % difference
  A        % all
  ?        % if
    @      % for loop variable
           % (implicit) end
           % (implicit) end
           % (implicit) convert to string and display
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 11: Matrix multiplication, manually</h3>
<pre><code>7L&amp;!*Xs6Be!
</code></pre>
<p>This illustrates the use of <strong>multidimensional arrays</strong>. These are a powerful tool, specially when coupled with dimension <strong>permuting</strong>  and broadcasting. The code takes two matrices and computes their matrix product (which could also be computed with the <code>Y*</code> function). <a href="http://matl.tryitonline.net/#code=N0wmISpYczZCZSE&amp;input=WzEgMiAzOyA0IDUgNl0KWzMgNCA1IDY7IC00IDMgMiAwOyAtNCAtNSA2IDhdIA" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>
<p>Function <code>7L</code> pushes the predefined literal <code>[2 3 1]</code>, and <code>&amp;!</code> applies that permutation of dimensions to the first (implicit) input. Let this input be an <em>M</em>×<em>N</em> matrix (2D numerical array). The permutation with <code>[2 3 1]</code> means that the 2nd dimension becomes the first, the 3rd becomes the second, and the 1st becomes the third. Since the input is a matrix, its 3rd dimension is actually a <strong>singleton dimension</strong>, that is, the size along that dimension is 1. In fact, any array can be assumed to have arbitrarily many trailing singleton dimensions. So the input matrix can be interpreted as an <em>M</em>×<em>N</em>×1 3D array, which after the permutation becomes an <em>N</em>×1×<em>M</em> array.</p>
<p>Function <code>*</code> takes a second (implicit) input and multiplies it by the previously obtained 3D array. The multiplication is element-wise with broadcast (see length-4 snippet). The second input has size <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>, or equivalently <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>×1, and the result of <code>*</code> has size <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em>. To obtain the matrix product, a sum is carried out along the first dimension using <code>Xs</code>. Note that the first dimension of the <em>N</em>×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em> array corresponds to columns of the first matrix and rows of the second matrix. The result of <code>Xs</code> has size 1×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em>.</p>
<p><code>6B</code> pushes 6 in binary, that is, the logical array <code>TTF</code> (or <code>[true true false]</code>). Then <code>e</code> is applied to collapse the first two dimensions of the 1×<em>P</em>×<em>M</em> array. This works as follows. <code>e</code> is used for <strong>reshaping</strong> arrays, and takes two inputs by default. With a logical array as second input, it collapses consecutive dimensions of the first input that have the same logical value in the second. So in this case it collapses the first and second dimensions, producing a <em>P</em>×<em>M</em> matrix.</p>
<p>Finally <code>!</code> transposes the matrix to yield the <em>M</em>×<em>P</em> final result.</p>
<h3>Length 12: show a simple image</h3>
<p>The code</p>
<pre><code>:i:!+t0)/3YG
</code></pre>
<p>takes two inputs and shows the following image (example for inputs <code>200</code>, <code>150</code>). Try it at <a href="https://matl.suever.net/?code=%3Ai%3A%21%2Bt0%29%2F3YG&amp;inputs=200%0A150&amp;version=19.7.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MATL online!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/JlWX5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/JlWX5.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p><code>:</code> takes an input <code>w</code> and generates the row vector <code>[1 2 ... w]</code>. <code>i:!</code> takes a second input <code>h</code> and produces the column vector <code>[1; 2; ...; h]</code>. <code>+</code> creates an <code>h</code>×<code>w</code> matrix with all pair-wise additions.</p>
<p><code>t0)</code> creates a copy of the matrix and extracts its last element. This uses <strong>linear indexing</strong>: a single index is used to access a two-dimensional array (matrix) in <strong>column-major</strong> order, i.e. down, then across. So for a <code>2</code>×<code>3</code> array the linear indices would be</p>
<pre><code>1 3 5
2 4 6
</code></pre>
<p>The index is interpreted in <strong>modular</strong> sense. This means that indices out of bounds are interpreted cyclically. The period of the cycle is the size of the indexed dimension; or, for linear indexing, the total number of elements of the array. So in the <code>2</code>×<code>3</code> example a linear index <code>8</code> is the same as <code>2</code>. <code>0</code> always corresponds to the last value in linear order, that is, last column and last row.</p>
<p>Thus <code>t0)</code> is the last element of the <code>h</code>×<code>w</code> matrix of pair-wise additions. By construction, this is the largest value. So the following <code>/</code> normalizes the array to maximum value <code>1</code>. Finally, <code>YG</code> is a function for <strong>displaying or saving images</strong>. It takes two inputs by default, and the last input specifies what the function actually does. <code>3</code> means that the function displays the matrix (first input) with each entry corresponding to one pixel on the screen, using a grey colormap by default.</p>

<div id="pu31" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/ZippyMagician/Arn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Arn</a></h1>
<p>Arn is a golfing language I designed recently. It's a functional paradigm with variable-based storage, and has a few cool features I enjoy. The full syntax can be found by clicking the name at the top of this post. An online interpreter can be found <a href="https://zippymagician.github.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for those interested.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<h2>Type casting</h2>
<p>Arn will automatically cast types based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays casting to Strings or Ints will take the 0th element.</li>
<li>Strings or Ints casting to Arrays will split on every character OR every space if there are any.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The variable <strong>_</strong> will be automatically assumed in any place where one a value is missing but required.</p>
<p>Similarly, any closing <strong>)</strong>, <strong>]</strong>, <strong>}</strong>, <strong>&quot;</strong>, <strong>'</strong>, or <strong>`</strong> can be ignored if it reaches the end of an expression or the program.</p>
<h2>STDIN</h2>
<p>STDIN will automatically be assigned to the variable <strong>_</strong> at runtime. It will be a string if STDIN is one line, or an array split on newlines otherwise.</p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>Since functions exist in this language, and that means a <strong>Standard Library</strong> can exist! You will see example functions for that later.</p>
<h2>Packing</h2>
<p>In order to help <strong>Arn</strong> compete with other, golfing languages, a packed form exists. This form is shorter, encoded based on a modified <strong>CP1252</strong> found <a href="https://github.com/ZippyMagician/Arn/wiki/Carn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. The average compression rate, as far as I've found, is ~17%.</p>
<p>I am very happy with the encoding, I spent hours and hours on it. It may change to become every more concise in the future (if possible, and if I can figure out how) but until then, this will be how it works.</p>
<p>The interpreter can run <strong>Carn</strong> (Compressed Arn) and regular <strong>Arn</strong> without any indication of which is passed.</p>
<h2>Compressed Strings</h2>
<p>Should be pretty self explanatory. They are based on a dictionary found <a href="https://github.com/ZippyMagician/Arn/blob/master/src/dictionary.js" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code is <code>F * 100 + S</code> OR <code>F * 100</code>, depending on if 1 valid compressed character or 2 are passed. Compressed strings are denoted with either <strong>'</strong> or <strong>`</strong>, where the former capitalized every word and the latter just the first. You can find a full description on the GitHub page, linked at the top of the post.</p>
<h1>Showcase</h1>
<p>From top to bottom.</p>
<h2>1 byte</h2>
<pre><code>_
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very simple program, it will just return STDIN. Output is implicit in this language.</p>
<h2>2 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>+4
</code></pre>
<p>This program will add 4 to STDIN and return it. The same as saying <code>_ + 4</code></p>
<h2>3 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>4,7
</code></pre>
<p>Above features the use of an infix; specifically, the <strong>,</strong> infix. This infix is the pair verb; it takes the left and right argument, turning them into an array.</p>
<h2>5 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>.fact
</code></pre>
<p>This little snippet shows us two new features (three, really!): the <strong>.</strong> infix, the <strong>fact</strong> function, and implicit casting. Since no value is passed to the <strong>.</strong> fix, it assumes <strong>_</strong> on the left. This is then passed to the factorial function. The factorial function uses the <strong>1-range</strong> fix, which takes an integer, and so <strong>_</strong> is automatically casted to an integer.</p>
<h2>7 bytes</h2>
<pre><code>+{+1}\~
</code></pre>
<p>This showcases the extremely useful <code>\</code> prefix. This prefix operates as both a fold and map fix; it will map using the block preceding it (if provided) and then fold with the fixes preceding <em>that</em>. This snippet also shows the <strong>1-range</strong> fix, <code>~</code>, in action.</p>
<p>Essentially, this program takes a number on STDIN. It creates a range, from [1, n] (where n is the input). Then it maps over this range, incrementing each entry by one. Finally, it adds all of the entries together.</p>

<p>I know the restriction is relaxed now but I &quot;wanted&quot; to follow the old rules, because 1. I'm lazy 2. I want people to care about it</p>
<p>And yes I do have more (currently hidden from the rest of the wrodl) snippets I'll post them if you upvote</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>1+ is a fun deque-based language (although it's often referred to as a stack-based language). <code>1</code> is the only literal and, furthermore, we only have <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> but not <code>-</code> or <code>/</code>, which makes some 1+ programs fairly hard to write. (Or probably I'm just not particularly clever whatever) It's still, however, easier to use than most Turing tarpits.</p>
<h3>1 byte</h3>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>The only literal in 1+. Almost no program can be built without it.</p>
<h3>2 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>1+
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, language name! It increments the top of the stack. This is where the name of the 1+ chatroom, &quot;increment&quot;, come from. It's non-trivial to decrement the top of the stack, however.</p>
<h3>3 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;&lt;*
</code></pre>
<p>Damn community wiki, I don't even know when I was upvoted... until now.</p>
<p>This snippet features the <code>&lt;</code> operator. It's the only comparison operator in 1+, and returns the boolean value <code>a &lt;= b</code> (where <code>b</code> is the stack top and <code>a</code> is the number behind it). Also, <code>&quot;</code> duplicates the top of the stack and <code>*</code> multiplies the top two numbers.</p>
<p>This snippet pops the stack if the stack have at least 2 numbers. (It is impossible to get back to an empty stack without outputting.) Because <code>a &lt;= a</code> is always true it replaces the stack top with <code>1</code>. Then the multiply operator get rid of that 1 since <code>a * 1 = a</code>.</p>
<h3>4 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>1+1&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>Inverts the top of stack. (That is, if the stack top is 0 replace it with 1, otherwise replace it with 0.) This actually turned out to be quite useful in some places, for example dealing with 1+ control flow.</p>
<p>It works by computing <code>a + 1 &lt;= 1</code> and not <code>a &lt;= 0</code> since pushing a zero is 5 bytes <code>11+1&lt;</code>.</p>
<h3>5 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>(|())
</code></pre>
<p>Infinite recursion. This is a function definition, but functions are executed once when they are declared in 1+ (very golfing-friendly).</p>
<p>The function declaration syntax in 1+ is <code>(name|code)</code> and it is called with <code>(name)</code>. Here the name of the function is empty and it calls itself repeatedly.</p>
<h3>7 bytes</h3>
<pre><code>(|&quot;&lt;##)
</code></pre>
<p>I don't have anything for 6 bytes, so here you go. This is a pop function that works anywhere (unless the stack is empty, of course). It's here to showcase the <code>#</code> instruction (The only other place I remember using this function is the input template) which is the only type of control flow. It pops a number n, and jumps to the instruction after the nth <code>#</code>. (It is 0-indexed, which is sometimes really annoying when golfing but sometimes, <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/208961/87986">not so much.</a>)</p>
<p>Functions creates &quot;seperate lines of execution&quot; according to original specs - this confuses lots of readers! Interpreter-wise, when executing a function, the interpreter calls itself. This means all <code>#</code> outside the function are ignored and the indexing starts from 0 again. (And all <code>#</code> inside the functions are ignored in the main line, that's what was meant by seperate lines of execution.)</p>
<p>This snippet creates a function with an empty name (because functions are executed once when they are declared, there are no need to call it). New function definitions overrides old definitions, so it will always work.</p>
<p><code>&quot;&lt;</code> replaces the top number with 1, the original value doesn't matter, much like the 3 byte snippet. The following <code>#</code> pops a number, in this case it is 1, and jumps to the second <code>#</code> (don't forget it's 0-indexed!) so the 1 is gone. Then we reached the end of the function.</p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>
<p>The International Phonetic Esoteric Language, or IPEL, is a stack-based esolang where the instruction set mostly consists of characters from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" rel="noreferrer">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>, and some ASCII.</p>
<p>IPEL is an attempt to apply stuff I've learned from some CS courses since starting college, as well as to create a language for myself for code golf.</p>
<h2>Length 1</h2>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>IPEL has 3 types: numbers, strings, and lists. Numbers from 0-9 can be pushed in by using the digit.</p>
<h2>Length 2</h2>
<pre><code>io
</code></pre>
<p>A simple cat program. <code>i</code> takes a string from STDIN, then outputs it with <code>o</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 3</h2>
<pre><code>&quot;a&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Pushes the string <code>a</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 4</h2>
<pre><code>1esø
</code></pre>
<p>This code increments the loop index by 1. In IPEL, loops are not handled by the interpreter; the programmer has to manually set the loop index. Loops also only check for when <span class="math-container">\$index \lt end\$</span>, where when true, jumps back to the start of the loop.</p>
<h2>Length 5</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;f&gt;/\

<p>An empty function definition.</p>
<h2>Length 6</h2>
<pre><code>{12.34}

<p>This is how you push a float and any numbers larger than 9. Surround it in curly brackets.</p>
<h2>Length 7</h2>
<pre><code>|a|ɔ|a|
</code></pre>
<p>Labels also exist in IPEL. When execution hits <code>ɔ</code>, it will jump to the label specified right after the <code>ɔ</code>. This is also the shortest infinite loop you can do in IPEL.</p>
<h2>Length 8</h2>

<h2>Length 9</h2>
<pre><code>{zzzzzzz}
</code></pre>
<p>IPEL since v1.4.0 includes the ability to push base 36 numbers. <code>zzzzzzz</code> is equivalent to <code>78364164095</code> in base 36.</p>
<h2>Length 17</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;f&gt;/1ue2sø\&lt;f&gt;2u3u
</code></pre>
<p>This is the shortest program that demonstrates changing the return pointer of a function call. Without <code>e2sø</code>, this would print <code>123</code>. With it would print <code>13</code> instead, completely skipping the 2 instructions <code>2u</code>. I'm not sure if there's any practical use for this, but it's a thing you can do.</p>

<h1>Zsh</h1>

<p>Zsh may seem like a new language, given the (relatively) recent popularity of the "Oh My Zsh" framework,
but it in fact dates back to 1990, just one year after Bash released.
Zsh's syntax is inspired by the bourne shell and ksh.</p>

<p>Many people are familiar with Bash scripting, but don't understand how Zsh differs. Zsh brings a surprising amount of powerful constructs.
I'll be highlighting these differences here.</p>

<h2>Length 1 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>:
</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to the command <code>true</code>. It returns zero (truthy in shell scripts).
Uses for this include short bodyless <code>for</code> loops: <code>for ((x;y;z)):</code></p>

<h2>Length 2 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$a
</code></pre>

<p>Parameter expansion. If <code>a</code> is set to some value, substitute that value.</p>

<p>Unlike in Bash and POSIX shells, if <code>$a</code> is an array, this will expand to all <em>non-empty</em> elements
(or, in the language of shells, "words") of <code>$a</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 3 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$=s
</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to the expansion <code>${=s}</code>, which induces word splitting.
For parameter expansion forms that involve a prefix (except for flags, see below) or modifiers (see below)
the surrounding braces can be removed if unambiguous.</p>

<p>Unlike in Bash and POSIX shells, word splitting is <em>not</em> done on parameters by default.
To split on <code>$IFS</code>, this construct is needed, or the option <code>shwordsplit</code> needs to be set.</p>

<h2>Length 4 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>*(.)
</code></pre>

<p>When expanding globs, Zsh supports <em>glob qualifiers</em> specified in parentheses after the glob.
Appending <code>(.)</code> as above will cause this glob to expand to all regular files in the directory.
There are dozens of globbing qualifiers, here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/</code>: Directories</li>
<li><code>F</code>: Non-empty directories</li>
<li><code>@</code>: Symlinks</li>
<li><code>U</code>: Files owned by the effective UID</li>
<li><code>Yn</code>: When <code>n</code> is a number, expand to the first <code>n</code> matches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 5 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>${~x}
</code></pre>

<p>This will expand <code>x</code> as a <em>glob</em>.
This is useful to match filenames, match <code>case</code> expressions, and in <code>[[</code> tests.</p>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>${s:l}
</code></pre>

<p>Zsh supports various <em>modifiers</em> to parameter expansion.
The <code>l</code> modifier will lowercase all words of <code>s</code>.
The equivalent construct in bash is <code>"${s,,}"</code> (or if <code>s</code> is an array: <code>"${s[@],,}"</code>.</p>

<p>Other useful modifiers include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>a</code>: Turns paths into absolute paths</li>
<li><code>A</code>: Turns paths into absolute paths with symlinks resolved</li>
<li><code>s/foo/bar</code>: Does replacement on each element. Use <code>gs/foo/bar</code> for global replacement.</li>
<li><code>&amp;</code>: Repeat the previous substitution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 7 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>${(i)@}
</code></pre>

<p>Zsh also supports roughly 30 parameter expansion <em>flags</em>.
The <code>i</code> flag will sort the parameters case-insensitively.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>k</code>: Substitute the array keys instead of values</li>
<li><code>P</code>: Induce indirect parameter expansion: if <code>a='b'</code> and <code>b='c'</code>, then <code>${(P)a}</code> expands to <code>'c'</code></li>
<li><code>q</code>: Quote characters special to the shell with backslashes or <code>$'\NNN'</code>. <code>q-</code> and <code>q+</code> will use different methods for quoting.</li>
<li><code>u</code>: Remove duplicate words in the expansion.</li>
<li><code>z</code>: Split into words according to shell parsing grammar: if <code>c='"a b" c'</code>, then <code>${(z)c}</code> will split into <code>"a b"</code> <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 8 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>xy${^a}z
</code></pre>

<p>With this expression, if <code>a</code> is some array (e.g.: <code>a=(hello world)</code>),
<code>a</code> is converted to a brace expansion (e.g.: <code>xyhelloz</code> <code>xyworldz</code></p>

<h2>Length 9 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;${str}
</code></pre>

<p>Like in bash, this is a <em>here-string</em>.
Unlike in bash, if no command is provided, the string is printed to stdout.
This can often be used as a replacement for <code>echo</code>,
except that the expansion of <code>${str}</code> occurs in a subshell.</p>

<h2>Length 10 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$a[(r)a?*]
</code></pre>

<p>Array subscripts also have flags! <code>r</code> is "reverse subscripting":
This will give the first word in <code>a</code> whose value matches <code>a?*</code>. (Likewise, <code>R</code> gives the last match.)</p>

<p>Other flags include <code>i</code> and <code>I</code> which <em>return</em> the indices or keys of the match,
<code>k</code> and <code>K</code> which <em>match</em> the keys, or <code>w</code> or <code>f</code> which split scalar <code>a</code> on words or lines, respectively.</p>

<h2>Length 11 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>b=(${@:*a})
</code></pre>

<p>This is another form of parameter expansion, it will expand to all words of <code>"$@"</code> that exist in the array <code>a</code>.
Similarly, <code>${@:|a}</code> will expand to the words of <code>$@</code> which do <em>not</em> exist in <code>a</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 12 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>${${(f)s}:h}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Zsh is that parameter expansions can be <em>indefinitely nested</em>.
So this will take <code>s</code>, split it on newlines, and then strip each line's the last path component. (<code>/usr/bin/zsh</code> ⇒ <code>/usr/bin</code>)</p>

<h2>Length 13 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$argv[i,i+10]
</code></pre>

<p>The numbered parameters <code>$@</code> can also be found under the named array <code>argv</code>.
For some purposes, this can be more convenient or more consistent if also working with other arrays.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get a substring or non-associative array.
The <code>${name:offset:length}</code> method works the same way in Bash,
but the <code>$name[start,end]</code> method is different:
The subscripts use <em>arithmetic expansion</em>, like you'd find in <code>$[ ]</code> or <code>$(( ))</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 15 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>print -P %D{%F}
</code></pre>

<p>Like Bash's <code>PS1</code> sequences, Zsh has its own prompt sequences.
<code>%D</code> expands to the current date, with an optional <code>{</code>string<code>}</code> after it.
That string will be passed to <code>strftime</code> to be expanded.</p>

<p>Variables can also be prompt-expanded with the <code>%</code> expansion flag: <code>${(%)foo}</code></p>

<h2>Length 16 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;$[[#16]8#755]
</code></pre>

<p>Arithmetic expansion supports any base from 2-36 (inclusive).
<code>n#...</code> will interpret the number at that base, while <code>[#n]</code> will return the number in that base.</p>

<p>The number will be printed as <code>base#number</code> (this example: <code>16#351</code>) with the exception of certain options and bases:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>setopt nocbases</code>: No special cases</li>
<li><code>setopt cbases</code>: Base 16 numbers will be printed as <code>0x[num]</code></li>
<li><code>setopt cbases octalzeroes</code>: Base 8 numbers will also be printed as <code>0[num]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With <code>setopt octalzeroes</code>, numbers with leading zeroes in arithmetic expansions will be interpreted as octal,
without needing the <code>8#</code> prefix.</p>

<h2>Length 19 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>setopt extendedglob
</code></pre>

<p>This deserves a post on its own...
This option adds a lot of new globbing options.
It's like changing from EREs to PCREs, but with globs.
I've started submitting <code>zsh -oextendedglob</code> as a language for some challenges.</p>

<h2>Length 29 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>for x y (${a:^^b})c+=$[$#x+y]
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, there's a lot here. This will:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>${a:^^b}</code>: Zip the arrays together, looping the shorter of the two arrays.</li>
<li><code>for x y (...)</code>: Pull words out two at a time, assigning them to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></li>
<li><code>b+=($[$#x+y])</code>: Add the length of <code>x</code> to the value of <code>y</code>, and append that to <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because only one operation is done for each iteration of the loop, no <code>{</code> <code>}</code> or <code>do</code> <code>done</code> is needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu36" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Keg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Keg</a></h1>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Keg is a stack-based golfing language, created by PPCG user <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/78850/jono-2906">Lyxal</a>, that focuses on simplicity and readability. It is fairly unique compared to most other golfing-based languages, since it has few instructions, and alpha-numeric characters are automatically pushed to the stack. It also has implicit input and output.</p>
<h3>Length One</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>An example of the stack controls in Keg. This rolls the stack, which puts the top of the stack to the bottom. It is the opposite of <code>'</code>, which rolls the stack in the opposite direction, putting the bottom of the stack at the top.</p>
<h3>Length Two</h3>
<pre><code>ab
</code></pre>
<p>Since these are alpha-numeric characters, they get auto-pushed to the stack as their respective ASCII values, which in this case are 97 and 98.</p>
<h3>Length Two (bytes)</h3>
<pre><code>ߞ
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is not an instruction, this will be pushed onto the stack automatically. Keg allows Unicode characters to be pushed onto the stack, so this pushes 2014.</p>
<h3>Length Three</h3>
<pre><code>83*
</code></pre>
<p>Any numbers get auto-pushed to the stack. In this case, it pushes 8, then pushes 3, and then multiplies them, giving 24.</p>
<h3>Length Four</h3>
<pre><code>¿:+.
</code></pre>
<p>This shows how duplicating items and integer printing works by using nice input (evaluation of input) to double the given number.</p>
<h3>Length Five</h3>
<pre><code>[a|b]
</code></pre>
<p>An example of an if statement in Keg. When an if statement is run, the top item of the stack is popped. If it is non-zero, the left code is run, whilst if it is zero, the right on the right is run. Note that the right side is optional</p>
<h3>Length Six</h3>
<pre><code>(56*|1
</code></pre>
<p>An example of a for loop in Keg. The number on the left side is how many times it'll run, whilst the code on the right is what's run. In this case, it pushes 1 to the stack 30 times. If the left side isn't specified, it will automatically be the length of the stack. Also, all ending brackets get automatically completed at the end of the program, making this valid.</p>
<h3>Length Seven</h3>
<pre><code>{!4&gt;|.}
</code></pre>
<p>An example of a while loop in Keg. The code on the left is the condition, and the code on the right is what's run. In this case, while the length of the stack is greater than 4, it outputs the top element of the stack as an integer.</p>
<h3>Length Eight</h3>
<pre><code>\ 
&amp; &amp;:.&amp; 
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates a unique features of escaping characters and accumulator usage. The \ instruction escapes the newline, which has an ASCII value of 10, then the accumulator is set to 10. After that, the accumulator value will be accessed and printed, resulting in the program printing 10.</p>
<h3>Length Nine</h3>
<pre><code>`Snippet`
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates the usage of strings in Keg. It pushes the string &quot;snippet&quot; and prints it.</p>
<h3>Length Eleven</h3>
<pre><code>^!~$%(_|&quot;)_
</code></pre>
<p>This showcases most of the commands in one concise program. This removes exactly 1 character from 1 line of input randomly.</p>
<h3>Length Twelve</h3>
<pre><code>@d1|:+ƒ¿@dƒ.
</code></pre>
<p>This defines a function called <code>d</code> and assigns the code <code>:+</code> to it (doubling the input passed to it). Nice input is then taken (<code>¿</code>) and <code>d</code> is called on the input.</p>

<div id="pu37" class="pu"><h2><a href="https://github.com/a-ee/w" rel="nofollow noreferrer">W</a></h2>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>W is a simple stack-based golfing language that is surprisingly very concise. Its powerful iterator protocol and implicit input system is the cause for this.</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>w
</code></pre>

<p>This is in fact a valid Truth-machine program (infinite 1 while 1). Let's explain it. The first step of the execution is to prepend all of the possible inputs to the stack:</p>

<pre><code>aaw
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the input is used both as the condition and as the body of the while loop. Therefore this program decodes to the following pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>while the input:
    print the input
</code></pre>

<p>The print is implicit in every while iteration. So if the input is <code>1</code> (a truthy value), this prints the input <code>1</code> indefinitely.</p>

<p>You might want to ask, could this code snippet produce the right result for a 0 input? Yes; the while loop returns the condition onto the stack after the execution, therefore 0 is outputted onto the stack.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE.</strong> W's while loop is only for demonstration purposes. Never use this instruction, because W is designed to allow users to use for loops over while loops.</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>+M
</code></pre>

<p>The W snippet that I am most proud of! It showcases more of W's powerful protocol.</p>

<p>So let us first try to make <code>'z'</code> (the string) as an input. The program outputs:</p>

<pre><code>aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz
</code></pre>

<p>Well, you might be confused by this odd output. Don't worry; I will explain it.</p>

<pre><code>aaa+M
</code></pre>

<p>This transpiles to:</p>

<pre><code>map(a,a+a)
</code></pre>

<p>Which means double every item in the string. If the string was <code>'ab'</code> then the output would be <code>'aabb'</code>.</p>

<p>So, <em>why in the world</em> would it return the doubled alphabet? Well, the <code>M</code>ap instruction has an automatic range that allows users to iterate over a singleton. (Because it is pointless to do so)</p>

<p>In this context, this will return a range from lowercase <code>a</code> to <code>z</code>, hence the doubled alphabet.</p>

<div id="pu38" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/SuperJedi224/ForceLang" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ForceLang</a></h1>

<p>ForceLang (name proposed by TanMath) is a programming language I published on January 12.</p>

<p>Functionality includes arbitrary-precision rational numbers, both console and GUI IO, and file input (file output has not yet been added, but will likely be added later)</p>

<p>Control flow is currently handled using gotoes, evaluated gotoes, and conditionals.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong> <code>0</code></p>

<p>A number literal for the rational number <code>0/1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong>: <code>io</code></p>

<p>The <code>io</code> namespace contains the language's console and file IO functionality. GUI IO is located in a separate namespace.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong> <code>nil</code></p>

<p>A constant field containing the null reference.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong> <code>0xFF</code></p>

<p>A <em>hexadecimal</em> number literal for the rational number <code>255/1</code> (hexadecimal literals can only be used for integers).</p>

<p>Hex literals are useful as color codes for the language's (currently somewhat limited) graphics library.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong> <code>11/13</code></p>

<p>A number literal for the rational number 11/13, which is stored exactly as a BigRational.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong> <code>!!TRUE</code></p>

<p>Obviously, this returns TRUE.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet:</strong> <code>def a a</code></p>

<p>An abuse of the <code>def</code> instruction that causes any subsequent attempts to evaluate the expression <code>a</code> to result in an infinite loop.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 snippet:</strong> <code>gui.show</code></p>

<p>A method that produces a simple gui alert.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong> <code>math.sqrt</code></p>

<p>Estimates the square root of a number as another BigRational. It does this by doing some math to find an integer which approximates this value, then applying four iterations of the Babylonian Method to this initial approximation.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong> <code>random.rand</code></p>

<p>The function <code>random.rand</code> can be used to produce random numbers on <code>[0, (2^m-1)/(2^m)]</code> for arbitrary positive integer values of <code>m</code> (effectively on <code>[0,1)</code> as <code>m</code> becomes large). When called with no arguments (<code>random.rand()</code>) it uses <code>m=80</code>.</p>

<p>Unsuspected-Hangul is functional esolang.</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Unsuspected-Hangul only uses 10 consonants of Korean character : <code>ㄱㄴㄷㄹㅁㅂㅅㅇㅈㅎ</code>, and other consonants are replaced by them. Vowels and final consonants are dismissed. Non-hangul(alphabet, number, white spaces) are all same.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>
<pre><code>강
</code></pre>
<p><code>ㄱㄴㄷㄹㅁㅂㅅㅈ</code> is number : From zero to seven.</p>
<p>Only initial consonant counts : so it is same as <code>ㄱ</code>, So it returns 0.</p>
<p><em>강 means river.</em></p>
<h3>Legnth 2</h3>
<pre><code>나무
</code></pre>
<p>Even-length number is negative, while odd-length number is positive. Every number is octal.</p>
<p>ㄴ is 1, and ㅁ is 7, and it is written backward, so <code>ㄴㅁ</code> is <code>-71</code>(octal), <code>-33</code>(decimal).</p>
<p><em>나무 means tree.</em></p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>
<pre><code>코끼리
</code></pre>
<p>This is odd-length, so it is positive. It is equivalent of <code>ㄱㄱㄹ</code>, <code>300</code>(octal), and <code>192</code>(decimal).</p>
<p><em>코끼리 means elephant.</em></p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<pre><code>집전화기

<p>Now introducing : types. Unsuspected-hangul has 7 types : Number, Boolean, String, List, Closure, IO, Nil.</p>
<p><code>ㅈㅈ</code> is built-in function that returns True. And <code>ㅎㄱ</code> calls function with 0 parameters.
So <code>ㅈㅈㅎㄱ</code> returns <code>True</code>.</p>
<p><em>집전화기 means Home telephone.</em></p>
<h3>Length 5</h3>
<pre><code>문자 한개
</code></pre>
<p>Non-hangul(like space) right before <code>ㅎ</code> can be omitted. <code>ㅁㅈ</code> is built-in function that changes number to string (if given with parameter). If <code>ㅁㅈ</code> called with no parameter, it just returns empty string.</p>
<p>So <code>ㅁㅈ ㅎㄱ</code> returns <code>''</code></p>
<p><em>문자 한개 means One character.</em></p>
<h3>Length 6</h3>
<pre><code>평범한 한글
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, It is name of the language. It is equivalent of <code>ㅂㅂㅎ ㅎㄱ</code>.</p>
<p><code>ㅎ</code> makes function. <code>ㅂㅂ ㅎ</code>( is <code>ㅂㅂㅎ</code>) is function that returns -45.</p>
<p><code>ㅎㄱ</code> calls function with no parameters, so it returns -45.</p>
<p><em>평범한 한글 means Ordinary Korean character, or Unsuspected Hangul.</em></p>
<h3>Length 7</h3>
<pre><code>또 또 신호등
</code></pre>
<p><code>ㄷ ㄷ ㅅㅎㄷ</code>. <code>ㅅ</code> is built-in function for power. <code>ㅎㄷ</code> calls function with two parameters. (Remember ㄷ means 2?)</p>
<p>So it calculates 2^2, and returns 4.</p>
<p><em>또 또 신호등 means Traffic light again again.</em></p>
<h3>Length 8</h3>
<pre><code>나 과제 다했다
</code></pre>
<p><code>ㄴ ㄱㅈ ㄷㅎㄷ</code>. <code>ㄷ</code> is built-in function for addition. <code>ㄱㅈ</code> is -56, so it calculates 1 + (-56), and returns -55.</p>
<p><em>나 과제 다했다 means I'm done with my assignment.</em></p>
<p><em>From github readme.md file.</em></p>
<h3>Length 9</h3>
<pre><code>그는 자는 척했다

<p><code>ㄱㄴ ㅈㄴ ㅈㅎㄷ</code>. <code>ㅈ</code> is built-in function for comparison. If first parameter is smaller than second parameter, returns true. <code>ㄱㄴ</code> is -8, and <code>ㅈㄴ</code> is -15. So it returns False.</p>
<p><em>그는 자는 척했다 means He pretended to sleep.</em></p>

<div id="pu40" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/Pyramid-Scheme" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pyramid Scheme</a></h1>

<p>With all the scheme dialects out there, I suppose it was inevitable that a Pyramid Scheme should arise. Created in early 2017 by our very own <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/31957/conor-obrien">Conor O'Brien</a>, this 2D esolang does in fact read very much like Scheme!</p>

<p>This little guy is the start of everything. The tip of a pyramid. Without the caret, there can be no Pyramid Scheme. On its own, though, it's not a valid program; you've gotta rest the pyramidion on something...</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>^
-
</code></pre>

<p>There it is. A full pyramid, complete with base and capstone. This 3-byter is the shortest program that will not error; it prints <code>0</code> followed by a newline and terminates gracefully. What it's really doing is accessing the default value of the variable-without-a-name; more on variables later, once we have larger pyramids.</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>​
^

</code></pre>

<p>Exactly as before, but now with a leading blank line! This program does nothing; it is the shortest possible program of the sort. Execution in Pyramid Scheme always begins on the first line. Each pyramidion on that first line is evaluated, and then the results are printed with linefeeds between if nothing has yet been printed. As the first line here is blank, nothing gets evaluated or printed.</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<p>On the other end, here's a program with more than one pyramid at the top. The one on the left will be evaluated first (yielding 0, as in the length-3), followed by that on the right. The results are collected in a list during execution; once all evaluation is complete, since nothing has yet been printed, the results are dumped to stdout:</p>

<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Scratch</a> is a graphical programming language created by MIT. Because it's graphical and block-based, rather than counting the number of characters, I'm going to count the number of blocks (after all, the number of characters could change with translations).</p>

<p>Rather than getting a screen shot of every single script I'll give you a link to a <a href="http://scratchblocks.github.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Scratchblocks</a> page. I'll also post the code for it below.</p>

</ul>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>when [space v] key pressed
set [Playing? v] to [1]
set [Score v] to [0]
reset timer

when this sprite clicked
if &lt;(Playing?) = [0]&gt;
  change [Score v] by [1]
end

when [timer v] &gt; (10)
set [Playing? v] to [0]
</code></pre>

<p>Well, we've got three whole scripts here! This should be simple enough to understand, but I'll explain it anyways.</p>

<pre><code>when [space v] key pressed
set [Playing? v] to [1]
set [Score v] to [0]
reset timer
</code></pre>

<p>When the space key is pressed, we want to set the playing variable to 1 (e.g. true), the score variable to 0 (e.g. no points yet), and <strong>reset the timer.</strong> The timer is an important part of this project!</p>

<pre><code>when this sprite clicked
if &lt;(Playing?) = [0]&gt;
  change [Score v] by [1]
end
</code></pre>

<p>When the sprite is clicked on, if we are currently playing, change the score by 1.</p>

<pre><code>when [timer v] &gt; (10)
set [Playing? v] to [0]
</code></pre>

<p>When the timer is greater than 10 (e.g. 10 seconds have elapsed since the timer has last been reset) set the playing variable to 0. Because it is now 0, in the when-sprite-clicked script the score is no longer increased.</p>

<p>By the way, here is the costume that the sprite uses:</p>

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key bit of information about this project is that you can have multiple scripts inside a single project. Each of these scripts will be called according to their hat block, so <code>when this sprite clicked</code> will happen when this sprite is clicked on!</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Getting a bit technical here, but <strong>Scratch does not use multiple threads.</strong> Instead you should think of scripts being stuck into a list of things to do. It's a bit complicated but works similarly to the way JavaScript does.</p>
    
    <p>Also, keep in mind that many blocks will automatically update the screen (as well as control events, for example, a loop looping) and will tell Scratch's interpreter to go on to the next script occurring simultaneously. You can get around this by putting your script inside of a run-without-screen-refresh custom block as shown in length 8.</p>

<p>What's so nice about Scratch is that it's scripts are <em>very</em> self-explanatory. I probably don't even need to explain to you what this does for you to figure it out (especially if you run the program by going to the above link).</p>

<p>However, this example does introduce a few new things I haven't shown yet:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sprites:</strong> These are Scratch's idea of <em>things</em> in the world (stage). A sprite is generally what you use when you want to add a character to your scene. Whenever you <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open up the editor</a>, you already get pre-loaded a sprite - it's that scratch cat! You can use as many sprites as you want in your program as well. Learn more about Sprites and how to create them on the <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Sprite" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broadcasts:</strong> A broadcast is as it sounds (literally) - it's a message that is sent through the project to every single sprite in the program. You use the <strong>when I receive</strong> hat to make something happen when a script is broadcasted. Broadcasts are a very important part of the programming language and you can learn more about them on the wiki <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Broadcast" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One last cool thing about this project is that if you change the numbers in the <code>go to x: y:</code> block it will always work - so why not try it?</p>

<p>Swift is a compiled language created by Apple, introduced in 2014 and is meant to replace Objective-C, the first supported language for OSX and iOS. Swift is currently used for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS development. It uses the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LLVM Compiler</a></strong></p>

<p>It focuses on writing less code (compared to Objective-C, which is very verbose) and handling safer types.
It features type inference, first-class type functions, closures, optional types, enum associated values and many more.</p>

<p>Swift is REPL, you can make your own idea by trying it on <del><a href="http://swiftstub.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://swiftstub.com/</a></del>, or <del><a href="http://www.runswiftlang.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.runswiftlang.com</a></del> (these sites were shut down), use <del><a href="https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/#/repl</a></del> instead.<br>

<h2>Snippets:</h2>

<h2>• <em>14</em></h2>

<pre><code>case let(8,x):
</code></pre>

<p>In a switch case, this statement is absolutely correct.<br>
That switch must have a tuple with two values. When evaluating the expression, if the first value is <code>8</code>, it enters the case and fills the <code>x</code> variable with the second value of the tuple so you can access it directly inside the case.</p>

<h2>• <em>11</em></h2>

<pre><code>/** #YES */
</code></pre>

<p>In Swift 2.0, comments can be written in Markdown. This produces a big title with <strong>YES</strong> as text. It can be displayed with format in the help navigator or quick help in Xcode.</p>

<h2>• <em>10</em></h2>

<pre><code>var i=10e8
</code></pre>

<p>It creates a double value with <code>1000000000.0</code> in it. You can even write it like this <code>1_000_000_000.0</code>. Swift accepts different number notations for scientific or currency purposes. It all leads to the same value in memory, but helps to clarify source code.</p>

<h2>• <em>9</em></h2>

<pre><code>f(#i:int)
</code></pre>

<p>When declaring a function, you have to name the formal and the actual parameter, but sometimes the actual parameter name is already a good formal parameter name. Instead of writing the name twice at declaration <code>func myFunc(aMarvelousInt aMarvelousInt: int)</code> you put a hash symbol in front of the parameter <code>func myFunc(#aMarvelousInt: int)</code>.<br>
This feature has been removed from Swift 2.0 because it's the default behavior. To prevent using the variable name as a method label, insert an underscore and a space before the variable name <code>func myFunc(_ aMarvelousInt: int)</code></p>

<h2>• <em>8</em></h2>

<pre><code>Array&lt;T&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Swift have generics, you can only insert objects of the specified type. The short notation of that array is <code>[T]</code>. In case you want to insert different types in an array, you must specify the type <code>AnyObject</code>, or <code>Any</code> if you don't insert <code>NSObject</code>s inside.</p>

<h2>• <em>7</em></h2>

<pre><code>let π=3
</code></pre>

<p>This declares a constant <code>π</code> containing a approximation of pi. In Swift, source code is in <strong>Unicode</strong>. Your variable names can even contain emojis <code>😃🚀🐑</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>6</em></h2>

<pre><code>"\(i)"
</code></pre>

<p>This returns a <code>String</code> with the value of <code>i</code> in it. The backslash escape character followed by a value in parentheses evaluates the content and inserts it in the string, or if it's a <code>printable</code> object, it uses its <code>description</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>5</em></h2>

<pre><code>(3,7)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a tuple with two integers. Tuples can be used to make functions return several values. To get the values, you specify the index. <code>(3,7).1</code> returns <code>7</code>. You can also name the values at declaration and access them with an identifier. <code>(hours: 12, minutes: 46, meridiem: "PM").minutes</code> returns <code>46</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>4</em></h2>

<pre><code>func
</code></pre>

<p>That's the way to declare functions. A function is a first class object.</p>

<h2>• <em>3</em></h2>

<pre><code>let
</code></pre>

<p>That's the way you declare constants. Constants have an optimisation in the compilation phase compared to the <code>var</code> declarations. An example is <code>let hoursInADay = 24.0</code>. Type inference makes that constant a <code>Double</code>.</p>

<h2>• <em>2</em></h2>

<pre><code>..
</code></pre>

<p>This was the operator for half opened range in Swift 1.0, but to avoid ambiguity with the closed range operator <code>...</code>, it has been replaced with <code>..&lt;</code> in Swift 1.1</p>

<p>You can use them in for loops (<code>for x in 0..&lt;5</code>), on in switch cases (<code>case (0..&lt;5): break</code>)</p>

<h2>• <em>1</em></h2>

<pre><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>All Semicolons are facultative, until you put more than one instruction in a line.</p>

In this case, <code>Bond[f, n]</code> returns a function which takes arguments <code>...x</code> and calls <code>f[...x, n]</code>. In the link, this is shown by example:</p>

<pre><code>f := Bond[`/, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>This function returns a function which returns the reciprocal of the input. This is roughly equivalent to the lambda:</p>

<pre><code>{ _ / 1 }

These arguments are accessible using <em>blanks</em>, with <code>_N</code> referring to the <code>N</code>th argument, starting at <code>_1</code>. <code>_</code> is short from <code>_1</code>. So, this function can be written as:</p>

<pre><code>{ _2 - _1 }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the 1st argument subtracted from the 2nd. In the example, we assign this function to <code>f</code>. Then, <code>f[3, 6]</code> is <code>6 - 3</code>, which evaluates to <code>3</code>.</p>

First, <code>~</code>, when used functionally, reverses the operands given to a function. So, for example, <code>(~V)[1, 2, 3]</code> would be called as <code>V[3, 2, 1]</code>, which gives <code>[3, 2, 1]</code>. <code>~</code> has the effect of reversing the order in which abstracts are called. The above function could be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>{-_2'_}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <code>'</code> operator, when used on data, concatenates them. Since <code>-</code> is unary, it negates <code>_2</code>. This is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>{ [ -_2, _1 ] }
</code></pre>

<p>Assign it as <code>f</code>, and <code>f[1, 2]</code> becomes <code>[-2, 1]</code>.</p>

<p><code>&amp;</code> when using data, <code>a&amp;b</code>, creates an array of <code>a</code> copies of <code>b</code>. So, <code>_&amp;_</code> creates <code>_</code> copies of <code>_</code>. <code>4&amp;4</code> is, for example, <code>[4, 4, 4, 4]</code>. Then, <code>Sum</code> is called on that array.

<div id="pu45" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bitwise_Cyclic_Tag" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Bitwise Cyclic Tag</a></h1>

<h3>Factoid:</h3>

<p>Bitwise Cyclic Tag is a programming language with only two commands, <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. It operates on an unbounded tape of bits and is <em>somehow</em> Turing-complete...? I don't yet understand this, but I'll be learning the language along with all of you. Bitwise Cyclic Tag is incredibly simple, even compared to brainfuck and other Turing tarpits, making it a very useful tool for proving other languages' Turing-completeness—if it can interpret BCT, it can do <em>anything</em>! In fact, our very own <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/66041/%C3%98rjan-johansen">Ørjan Johansen</a> did just this to prove <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki////" rel="nofollow noreferrer">///</a> Turing-complete in 2009, writing <a href="http://oerjan.nvg.org/esoteric/slashes/bct.sss" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this interpreter</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>0
</code></pre>

<p>This here is half of the language. When a zero bit is encountered in the code, the first bit of the data tape is discarded (some implementations print it as well). That's it. </p>

<p>This program demonstrates an important feature of BCT: the code is not run just once, but over and over until the data tape is empty (hence, "cyclic"), at which point execution halts. Therefore, this 0.125-byte program can be considered a sort of cat program, as in any implementation that prints on discard, this will print the entire starting data tape in order and exit gracefully. </p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>This here is the other command in BCT. It's a touch more complicated. When a one bit is encountered in the code, if the first data bit is a one, the following bit in the code is appended to the data (on the end). If the first data bit is a zero, nothing happens. In either case, the bit in the code immediately following the <code>1</code> is skipped. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that I was not completely honest about repeated execution in the first snippet. The code is treated as a loop (think Haskell's <code>repeat</code>), so if this snippet is executed, the bit possibly written is the <code>1</code> itself. This snippet, then, will infinitely add ones to the end of the data if the tape starts with a <code>1</code> or do nothing forever otherwise. </p>
</div>
<div id="pu46" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/tomtheisen/stax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stax</a></h1>

<p>Stax is a stack-based golf-oriented language.  That's a pretty crowded space, but stax has a few novel properties.  There's an <a href="https://staxlang.xyz/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter</a>.</p>

<h2>Two stacks</h2>

<p>There are two data stacks, "main" and "input".  The language name is inspired by this.  Normally standard input starts on the input stack, split into lines.  Most operations operate on the main stack.  However, if the main stack is empty, read operations fall back to the input stack instead.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<p>Falsy values are numeric zeroes and empty arrays.  All other values are truthy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Integer</strong> Aribitrary size</li>
<li><strong>Float</strong> Standard double precision</li>
<li><strong>Rational</strong> Fractions of integers</li>
<li><strong>Block</strong> Reference to unexecuted code for map/filter/etc</li>
<li><strong>Array</strong> Heterogeneous lists of any values</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compressed string literals</h2>

<p>Stax has a variant of string literals suitable for compressing English-like text with no special characters.  It is compressed using Huffman codes.  It uses a different set of Huffman codes for every pair of preceding characters.  The character weights were derived from a large corpus of English-like text.  <code>"Hello, World!"</code> could be written as  <code>`jaH1"jS3!`</code>.  The language comes with a compression utility.</p>

<h2>Crammed integer arrays</h2>

<p>Similarly to compressed string literals, stax also has a special feature for efficiently representing arrays of arbitrary integers.  It uses almost all the printable ascii characters.  It uses the information in each character efficiently to embed how long each integer is, and their values.  This feature is new in Stax 1.0.6.</p>

<h2>Debugger</h2>

<p>Stax has a web-based development and execution environment.  It runs entirely client-side with no ajax calls.  It features a step-through debugger that shows the current state, including all registers, stacks, and current instruction.  <code>|`</code> is a programmatic break instruction.  There is also a C# GUI and CLI for Stax.</p>

<h2>PackedStax</h2>

<p>PackedStax is an alternative representation for Stax code.  It is never ambiguous with Stax, since PackedStax always has the leading bit of the first byte set.  That means the same interpreter can be used for both representations with no extra information.  For ease of clipboard use, PackedStax can be represented using a modified CP437 character encoding.  It yields ~18% savings over ASCII.</p>

<h2>Rationals</h2>

<p>Stax supports fraction arithmetic.  You can use <code>u</code> to turn an integer upside down. So <code>3u</code> yields <code>1/3</code>.  Fractions are always in reduced terms.  <code>3u 6*</code> multiplies 1/3 by 6, but the result will be <code>2/1</code>.</p>

<h2>Implicit input eval</h2>

<p>Normally the text in the input starts in the input stack.  The stax runtime can parse input into stax data structures.  This is rather convenient for many PPCG posts, where input formats are flexible.  This happens only when certain conditions are met.</p>

<ul>
<li>Input contains no newlines</li>
<li>Parsing input succeeded.  Support types are integers, floats, rationals, strings, and arrays.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, this input would be parsed into corresponding values on the input stack.</p>

<pre><code>1 2.3 [4/5, "foo"]
</code></pre>

<h2>Snippet: Length 0</h2>

<p>An empty program in stax will reduce a fraction.  This is the result of automatically evaluated input, and a built-in rational type.  Rational values are always in reduced terms.  And since there's no explicit output in the program, the top of the stack is implicitly printed.</p>

<h3>Snippet: Length 1</h3>

<p>A one character stax program can filter out the blank lines from standard input.  <code>f</code> is generally used to use a block to filter an array, but when it's the first character of a program, it uses the remainder of the program to filter the input lines.  The rest of the program is blank, so the filter is an identity filter, and blank lines are falsey.</p>

<h3>Snippet: Length 4</h3>

<p>In 4 bytes, you can use a block to map each character to its ascii code in hexadecimal.

<p>The lambda calculus (specifically, the untyped lambda calculus) is, according to Wikipedia, &quot;a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.&quot; It was published by mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Alonzo Church</a>, of whom Alan Turing was a student, in 1936, and is equivalent to a Turing machine—that is, any problem solvable with an algorithm can be solved with this system.</p>

<pre><code>λx.x
</code></pre>
<p>The identity function! This gives a first look at the form of functions. A lambda function consists of two parts: the parameter (the variable between the first <code>λ</code> [lowercase Greek letter lambda] and the first <code>.</code>), and the return value (everything after the first <code>.</code>). In this example, the parameter, <code>x</code>, is mapped to (guess) <code>x</code>, so the identity function returns whatever value it is fed, be it a number, a Boolean, or a lambda term.</p>
<p>This is an example of an inductive rule of lambda terms: if <code>t</code> is a lambda term and <code>x</code> is a variable, then <code>λx.t</code> is a lambda term. In this example, <code>t</code> is the lambda term <code>x</code>, so this rule makes <code>λx.x</code> a lambda term.</p>
<h3>Length 4:</h3>
<pre><code>λx.y
</code></pre>
<p>A slightly less interesting example, this is a function of <code>x</code> that returns <code>y</code> regardless of <code>x</code>'s value. Feed it <code>5</code>? It gives <code>y</code>. Feed it <code>λx.y</code>? It gives <code>y</code>. Since y is a variable and therefore a lambda term, this expression is indeed a lambda term.</p>
<h3>Length 5:</h3>
<pre><code>f x y
</code></pre>
<p>This is application of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying" rel="nofollow noreferrer">curried function</a>, the basis of the computational completeness of the lambda calculus. <code>f</code> is here called on <code>x</code>, returning <code>f(x)</code>, a function (this is called partial application—though <code>f</code> takes two parameters, one can create a new function by passing <code>f</code> only one). This new function is then applied to <code>y</code>. Because of the left-associativity of the lambda calculus, this is read as <code>(f(x))(y)</code> instead of <code>f(x(y))</code>.</p>
<p>An example of a use for this form: <code>f</code> maps <code>x</code> to a function that maps <code>y</code> to <code>x+y</code>. This is a change through currying of the basic addition function; instead of writing <code>plus(x, y)</code>, we write <code>plus(x)(y)</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 7:</h3>
<pre><code>λx.λy.x
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, something interesting! This function of x returns not a value, but another function! The return value is <code>λy.x</code> (which is effectively identical to <code>λx.y</code> above), so this expression takes an argument <code>x</code> and returns the constant-value function that returns the given <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>This function has some interesting behavior in conjunction with certain others, very similar to that of the Boolean true.</p>
<h3>Length 7:</h3>
<pre><code>λx.λy.y
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the previous example, but it returns the identity function rather than a constant-value one. As you will see soon, this can be made to behave like Boolean false.</p>
<p>This and the previous example are known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_Booleans" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Church booleans</a>.</p>
<h3>Length 7:</h3>
<pre><code>λf.λx.x
</code></pre>
<p>This very closely resembles the Church false; in fact, it is identical, despite the f and x in place of x and y! Through a process called α-conversion, the lambda term <code>λx.R</code> can become the equivalent expression <code>λy.R'</code>, where <code>R'</code> is <code>R</code> with all instances of <code>x</code> replaced with <code>y</code>. This is intuitive enough—if <code>f(x)=2x</code> and <code>g(y)=2y</code>, then <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are equivalent.</p>
<p>The different notation for this function and the Church false is to aid intuition. While the latter takes any two arguments and returns the second, this one is intended to take a function of a value (<code>f</code>) and a value (<code>x</code>). It then applies <code>f</code> to <code>x</code> <strong>zero times</strong> and returns the result.</p>
<p>With certain other convenient functions, this one can be treated as the number zero. This is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_numerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Church numeral</a>.</p>
<h3>Length 8:</h3>
<pre><code>(λx.x) y
</code></pre>
<p>Application of a function again, but this one actually does something, instead of merely serving as a template! The function <code>λx.x</code> is applied to the variable <code>y</code>, done by substituting <code>y</code> for <code>x</code> (the parameter) in the return value, <code>x</code>. This yields <code>y</code>, as one might expect from applying the identity function to <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>This process of replacing each instance of the parameter in the return value with the argument is called β-reduction.</p>
<h3>Length 9:</h3>
<pre><code>λf.λx.f x
</code></pre>
<p>Ooh, something exciting! This looks like the Church numeral for zero, but with <code>f x</code> in place of <code>x</code>. Here, the function <code>f</code> is applied <strong>once</strong> to <code>x</code>, and this result is returned. We'll call this the Church numeral for one. Noticing a pattern? Yep, the Church numeral for <code>n</code> returns a function of <code>x</code> that returns <code>f</code> applied to <code>x</code> <code>n</code> times.</p>
<h3>Length 14:</h3>
<pre><code>λa.λb.λf.f a b
</code></pre>
<p>This function pairs two values, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, creating a function that takes a function parameter <code>f</code> and returns <code>f</code> applied to <code>a</code>, applied to <code>b</code>. These pairs, known as Church pairs, will become very useful later on.</p>
<p>Of course, pairs would be useless without a way of retrieving their elements:</p>
<h3>Length 12:</h3>
<pre><code>λp.p λx.λy.x
</code></pre>
<p>This takes as input a Church pair and returns the first of the pair. Suppose <code>p</code> is the pair <code>(a, b)</code>. By the definition of pairs, <code>p</code> applied to <code>λx.λy.x</code> (Church true) is equivalent to <code>λx.λy.x</code> applied to <code>a</code>, applied to <code>b</code>. This returns <code>a</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 12:</h3>
<pre><code>λp.p λx.λy.y
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, this function returns the second element of a pair. Confirmation of this is left as an exercise for the reader (hint: it's the same as that for the previous snippet).</p>
<h3>Length 18:</h3>
<pre><code>λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)
</code></pre>
<p>Y'know what? Rather than adding a separate snippet for each natural number, why don't we include a recursive way of defining them? This is the successor function, one which takes as input a Church numeral and returns the next.</p>
<p>Here's an example: let's call this function on 1's Church numeral, <code>λf.λx.f x</code>. This gives us <code>(λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)) (λf.λx.f x)</code>, which is by α-conversion equivalent to <code>(λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)) (λg.λy.g y)</code> (this is done to avoid name collisions). β-reduction turns this into <code>λf.λx.f ((λg.λy.g y) f x)</code>.</p>
<p>Apply β-reduction once more, inside the parentheses, and we have <code>λf.λx.f ((λy.f y) x)</code>. Again! <code>λf.λx.f (f x)</code>... Ooh! This looks like what I would expect two's Church numeral to be! How nice.</p>
<p>Another look at the successor function reveals that it is quite intuitive: it takes a Church numeral <code>n</code> and returns another Church numeral, one that returns a function <code>f</code> applied to <code>n</code> applications of <code>f</code> to <code>x</code>—that is, <code>n+1</code> applications of <code>f</code> to <code>x</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 30</h3>
<pre><code>λa.λb.a (λn.λf.λx.f (n f x)) b
</code></pre>
<p>Spamming successor functions gets tedious. Let's skip all that and define addition! This snippet takes two Church numerals <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and returns their sum, as a Church numeral.</p>
<p>Of course, we must test this. Note that the outer parentheses contain the successor function exactly; since we already understand that one, let's just call it <code>SUCC</code> now. Our expression becomes <code>λa.λb.a SUCC b</code>.</p>
<p>Let's add two and three (defining <code>TWO</code> as <code>λf.λx.f (f x)</code> and <code>THREE</code> as <code>SUCC TWO</code>). <code>(λa.λb.a SUCC b) TWO THREE</code> is β-reduced to <code>(λb.TWO SUCC b) THREE</code> and again to <code>TWO SUCC THREE</code>. This does PRECISELY what we'd hoped—it applies succession to three two times, yielding two plus three!</p>

<div id="pu48" class="pu"><h1>HQ9+</h1>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/HQ9%2B" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HQ9+</a> is a joke programming language, invented by Cliff L. Biffle in 2001. It is a golfing language, that has a very small source code for the most common programming exercises, due to its small set of strategic built-ins.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>Q
</code></pre>

<p>HQ9+ has a very short quine. The <code>Q</code> built-in prints the source code of the entire program.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>9+
</code></pre>

<p>Speaking about crazy built-ins, HQ9+ is almost comparable to Mathematica. This program prints the entire lyrics of "99 bottles of beer on the wall", before it increments the accumulator and terminates.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>

<pre><code>9H9
</code></pre>

<p>Commands can be mixed and matched in any order you want. This program, for instance, takes a break and greats the world between two passes through the already mentioned song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."</p>

<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>HQ9+
</code></pre>

<p>Yup, The name of the language is actually a syntactically valid program by itself. One thing to notice here is how <code>Q</code> behaves when there are other characters in the program as well. In between hello world and 99 bottles of beer, it prints "HQ9+". While not a quine, the source code is at least part of the output.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>+++++
</code></pre>

<p>There are no other operations than <code>+</code> that can be applied to the accumulator. Thus, if we want to increase it by five, this is the shortest way to do it. While backwards compatible with HQ9+, the popular object-oriented extension of the language by David Morgan-Mar, HQ9++, is also going to create two new subclasses of the generic superclass if this code is executed. The output is the same though.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>QH99QH
</code></pre>

<p>We have seen that HQ9+ is capable of only a limited number of outputs, however, it can still output any <em>information</em>. Using the highest density of information per command (e.g. avoid to increase the accumulator), the flow rate of information is log2(3) bits per command. For many languages, this is not known exactly, but for English text it is assumed to be <a href="http://for%20English%20text" rel="nofollow noreferrer">around 1.3 bits per character</a>, a little less than HQ9+. I have here as an example chosen a tertiary encoding, where the output of the <code>H</code> command here represents a <code>0</code>, <code>Q</code> represents <code>1</code> and <code>9</code> represents <code>2</code>. Using that, the output of the program can be interpreted as "SE" for Stack Exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>QQQQQQQ
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly many get this one wrong, they think <code>Q</code> prints just a Q. But Each <code>Q</code> actually prints the whole source code of the program, here resulting in </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ<br>
  (49 of them)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a great tool for demonstrating quadratic growth, and make it possible for HQ9+ to be used in surprising ways, like in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/59497/53025">this answer</a> printing twice the length of the program to STDOUT.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>

<pre><code>+++Q++++
</code></pre>

<p>As the <code>+</code> command is effectively a NOP regarding output, a single <code>Q</code> placed anywhere in a string of <code>+</code> can be used to produce a quine of arbitrary length.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>BURLESQUE
</code></pre>

<p>Is this a quine or not? That depends on the interpreter used. It is not very clear in the specification if invalid characters should be ignored or not. In the interpreters that do ignore such characters, this is proper quine. Others just throw an error. That is not necessarily more correct either, as error management is not accurately specified either. (Ehm.. It is not mentioned...)</p>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre><code>H+H+H+H+H+
</code></pre>

<p>Many people will probably have some concerns about to language because of the very permissive specification potentially leading to spaghetti code or bad programming practises. This example is an attempt to disprove this myth by adapting principles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">structured programming</a>, by carefully incrementing the accumulator after each successfully executed statement. Each and every instruction is thus properly clarified.</p>

<p><strong>Length 12</strong></p>

<pre><code>219661 beers
</code></pre>

<p>Is it still possible to find interesting long programs in HQ9+? Well, we can take a look at iterating programs. If the above snippet is run through an interpreter ignoring non-existing commands, the <code>9</code> triggers our familiar song. The output, if you analyse it, contains exactly 60 <code>9</code>'s. Suppose we feed that back as an input, we end up with 60 new runs of the song. The number grows exponentially, so after three iterations, we have reached a total of 219661. Also worth mentioning is the growth of "Hello, world!". Each run of the song spawns 101 new ones (2 per verse, one extra in "t<strong>H</strong>e store"), and each one produces one child in the next iterations. That should give us 369761 in total on the third iteration.</p>

<div id="pu51" class="pu"><h1>Common Lisp</h1>
<p>Lisp (from LISt Processing) is one of the oldest languages still in use today (only FORTRAN is older). It is notable for being the first language where code is data and data is code; called homoiconicity. It was also the first language to have garbage collection. Originally designed by John McCarthy in a 1958 paper as an entirely theoretical language, it became a real language when Steve Russel realized that the eval function could be implemented on a computer. It's most prevalent in Artificial Intelligence, and is instantly recognizable from its preponderance of parentheses. Common Lisp was designed to unify many of the older Lisp dialects into a more standardized form.</p>
<p>I'll be trying for every snippet to be runnable on it's own, though not necessarily do anything of value. Additionally, because I'm using Common Lisp, the fundamental concepts and a lot of the syntax apply in other dialects, but certain functions won't work in, say, Scheme.</p>
<h3>Length 1</h3>
<pre><code>*
</code></pre>
<p>Because of the emphasis on the use of S-Expressions and lists for coding, there're very few valid expressions in Lisp that don't contain parentheses, called atoms. Anything typed directly into the REPL (read-eval-print loop) is treated as a variable and evaluated as such. <code>*</code> holds the previous value that was printed by the REPL.</p>
<h3>Length 2</h3>
<pre><code>()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the empty list, one of the most important symbols in Lisp. Every proper list in Lisp is terminated with an empty list, similar to how every proper string in C ends with <code>\0</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>
<pre><code>(*)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a basic function call, which consists of a symbol wrapped in parentheses. Lisp doesn't contain operators, they're just functions too. I picked multiplication specifically because it's not actually a binary function; the multiplication operator in Lisp takes an indefinite number of arguments. If it is given no arguments it returns <code>1</code>, the identity operator for multiplication.</p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<pre><code>`(1)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a cons cell, which is just another way of saying it's a pair of elements. In Lisp, each list consists of cons cells connected to cons cells, where the first element (the <code>car</code>) is the value and the second element (the <code>cdr</code>) points to the next cons cell. This forms the basis of Lisp being based upon linked lists. This particular cons cell has <code>1</code> as the car and the empty list as its cdr.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<h3>Length 7</h3>
<pre><code>(not t)
</code></pre>
<p>I want to touch on truth values in Lisp. This would return <code>nil</code>. In Common Lisp, <code>t</code> is the symbol for true while <code>nil</code> and <code>()</code> represent false and are equal to each other, but note that this definition isn't standard for all Lisp dialects; Scheme, for example, distinguishes between <code>#f</code> for false and <code>'()</code> for the empty list.</p>
<h3>Length 9</h3>
<pre><code>(cdr ())
</code></pre>
<p>As I said before, the cdr is the tail element of a list, which you can get with the function <code>cdr</code>. Likewise, you can get the head element, the car, with the function <code>car</code>. Pretty simple, right? The car and cdr of the empty list are both <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 10</h3>
<pre><code>(cons 1 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, enough length to start working with lists. <code>cons</code> creates a cons cell with the first parameter as the car and the second as the cdr. But instead of printing out <code>(1 2)</code>, it gives <code>(1 . 2)</code>. Going back to the length 2 snippet, a proper list is supposed to end with the empty list, so the cdr of the last cons cell should point to the empty list. In this case, the last cons cell points to <code>2</code>, so Lisp informs us that we have an improper list, but still allows us to do it, like how you can make a C-string without a <code>\0</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 11</h3>
<pre><code>(cons 1 ())
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have created our first properly formed list. It's a single cons cell with a car of <code>1</code> and a cdr of <code>()</code>. You'll notice that for every other list, I lead it with a backquote/tick; any other proper list would attempt to evaluate its first argument as a function with the remaining elements as parameters. Strictly speaking, <code>()</code> isn't a list though; it's a symbol composed of a <code>(</code> and a <code>)</code> that represents the empty list. Lisp allows you to use almost any printable character in a symbol name and will let you redefine any symbol as you want to.</p>
<h3>Length 12</h3>
<pre><code>(cdr `(1 2))
</code></pre>
<p>This would output <code>(2)</code>, not <code>2</code> as some people would guess. Remember, each cdr is supposed to point to either another cons cell or the empty list; obviously <code>2</code> isn't the empty list, so it must be another cons cell the a car of <code>2</code> and a cdr of <code>()</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 13</h3>
<pre><code>'#1=(1 . #1#)
</code></pre>
<p>This would produce a circular list with just the single value 1. If printed, it would print “(1 1 1 1 ...” forever, so that in practice it can be considered an infinite list (on which you can do <code>cdr</code> infinite times to obtain always the same result, itself!). Unless one assigns <code>T</code> to the global variable <code>*print-circle*</code>, in which case it will be printed as <code>#1=(1 . #1#)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong></p>
<p>Shakespeare's code resembles, as one would expect, a Shakespeare play, where the variables are characters on the play and their value changes as they are &quot;insulted&quot; or praised&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>I
</code></pre>
<p>Shakespeare's code is divided in Acts, and the acts are themselves divided in Scenes, for &quot;jump-to&quot; causalities. Defining an Act as <code>Act I</code> means that it will be the first piece of the code to be run, per example - but not only.</p>

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>day

<p>By now, you may be getting the feeling that SPL is very verbose. And weird. And you've seen nothing yet. <code>day</code>, in SPL, is 1. All &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; nouns are considered as <code>1</code>, as well as all &quot;negative&quot; ones are <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>rich

<p>What is <code>rich</code>? An adjective. In SPL, adjectives make the value of the noun they're attached to multiply by two. See implementation on snippet 14.</p>

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Act I

<p>Implementation of the first snippet. All acts may be given a title, such as <code>Act I: Hamlet must die!</code>, since everything after the Roman numeral is ignored by the parser.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>better
</code></pre>
<p>Every language has conditions, and SPL is no exception. Except, since this is a language with a lengthy syntax (and did I mentioned it to be weird?), its conditional statements are going to be long. Having Ophelia ask Juliet <code>Am I better than you?</code> is like having <code>if (Ophelia &gt; Juliet)</code> on most &quot;normal&quot; languages. And, of course, you can ask the other way around: <code>Am I not better than you?</code> is the equivalent of <code>if (Ophelia &lt; Juliet)</code>. And you can already guess how the <code>=</code> is translated to SPL: <code>as good as</code> - usage of code snippet 2.</p>
<p>However, <code>good/better</code> is not the only way to make comparisons in this shakesperian language, you can use any adjective. The same principle of snippet 3 applies here as well, with &quot;positive&quot; adjectives having the value <code>&gt;</code>, while &quot;negative&quot; ones mean <code>&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>A limitation of SPL is that it has a limited number of variables: Romeo, Juliet, Hamlet, Ophelia, MacBeth and so on are a few examples of &quot;characters&quot; that will appear on a Shakesperian program.</p>

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Exeunt]
</code></pre>
<p><code>[Exeunt]</code> is placed when all &quot;characters&quot; leave the &quot;stage&quot;. Hopefully I can elaborate a bit more later on about the interaction between characters. Generally is the last instruction of any SPL program, although <code>[Exeunt]</code> isn't specifically the terminal &quot;character&quot; of the language. For another example, see snippet 27.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>as bad as

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>difference

<p><strong>Factoid</strong>
<em>(since I managed somehow to reach ten snippets of code, let's take a bit of a break and have another factoid about SPL)</em></p>
<p>If you want to run your shakesperian code in all its glory, there's <a href="https://shakespearelang.org/" rel="noreferrer">this site</a> - I'm still testing it, since I discovered it not even five minutes ago. There's also a way to translate it to C using <a href="http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/#SECTION00070000000000000000" rel="noreferrer">a translator</a>.</p>
<p>Another site for running SPL code is <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=SPL" rel="noreferrer">this one</a> that works by internally translating the SPL code to another esoteric language: Oracle PL/SQL.</p>
<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Exit Romeo]
</code></pre>
<p>Yes! At last I can talk about the interaction between characters! In order to have its value changed or to interact with others, a &quot;character&quot; must be on stage - entering with <code>[Enter Romeo]</code>. If a character is addressed to but is not present, there's a runtime error and the program stops. Because, in SPL, the value of the variables is set by the amount of names they're praised with - or insulted with - by the other characters on stage. I feel that I should put an example to clear some confusion my lame explanation may create, but perhaps it's best to delay that a few snippets.</p>
<p><strong>Length 12 snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Remember me.
</code></pre>
<p>SPL is pretty &quot;basic&quot;, alright - but it has stacks! When, per instance, Romeo tells Juliet to &quot;remember him&quot;, he's actually telling his loved one to push the Romeo's value into her stack. Popping the value is done with <code>Recall your happy childhood!</code>, or <code>Recall your love for me</code>, or basically any sentence that begins with <code>Recall</code> - the rest is just artistic drivel, like snippet 22.</p>
<p><strong>Length 13 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Let us return
</code></pre>
<p>The Shakesperian way of having a <code>goto</code>. And this is where the Acts and Scenes come in handy. If Romeo tells Juliet <code>we shall return to Act II</code> (yes, again, there are multiple ways of write it), the program will jump to that specific part of the code. It's also seen alongside conditional statements.</p>
<p><strong>Length 14 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>my little pony
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, it was a series back in the 80s. Here, it's <code>2*1</code>. Why? Because a <code>pony</code> is a (somewhat) positive noun and <code>little</code> is an adjective. So, remembering snippets 3 and 4, we have <code>little = &quot;2 *&quot;</code> and <code>pony = &quot;1&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Speak thy mind!
</code></pre>
<p>In a SPL program, you'll see this (or <code>Speak your mind!</code>, which is the same) <em>a lot</em>. This basically outputs the value of each &quot;character&quot; in digit, letter or anything else, depending on the character set being used by your computer. There's also <code>Open your mind.</code> that does almost the same thing, albeit only outputting in numeric form.</p>
<p><strong>Length 16 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>You are nothing!
</code></pre>
<p>When someone tells you this in real life, you'll feel depressed. When Ophelia tells this to Hamlet in Shakespearian programming, Hamlet feels worthless. What does this mean? That <code>Hamlet = 0</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Ophelia, a wench.
</code></pre>
<p>In a screenplay, before the actual play starts, the characters must be presented. In most programming languages, the variables must also be declared before use. Seeing that SPL is a programming language that resembles a screenplay, this is how you declare its variables, by stating which are the ones appearing during the program.</p>
<p>But what does &quot;a wench&quot; mean? Does it mean that it's a specific (and cool) data type name? Well... I hate to disappoint you, but it means nothing: everything after the comma is disregarded by the parser, meaning you can put there the most outrageous drivel you can think of.</p>

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Romeo:
 Remember me.
</code></pre>
<p>At last!!! I can finally output a full correct syntax instruction (albeit a short one)! This is how you use snippet 12: firstly you declare who's talking, then on the next line you write the &quot;dialogue&quot;. Normally, only two &quot;characters&quot; are on stage, to avoid making the parser sad and confused. When you need another &quot;character&quot;, you take one from the stage and replace him by the new one.</p>
<p><strong>Length 20 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>cube of thy codpiece
</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to elaborate a bit more for this one, but, truth be told, the things I come up with are still too short for this snippet length. And, so, I bring you this, which ends up being <code>-1</code> - because (-1)<sup>3</sup> = -1 (and <code>codpiece</code> is a &quot;negative&quot; noun, since they're uncomfortable and all). SPL understands a few more elaborate arithmetic operations as <em>some</em> exponentiation and square roots.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong> <em>(yet another one, since we've reached another milestone)</em></p>
<p>The &quot;Hello World Program&quot; in Shakesperian has 89 lines and more than 2400 characters long, <a href="http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/#SECTION00091000000000000000" rel="noreferrer">as seen here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 21 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Listen to your heart.

<p>In snippet 15 you outputted something; here, you input a number to the program. If you want to input a character, you'll use <code>Open your mind.</code> instead. And, needless to say, this value will be stored in the &quot;character&quot; being spoken to.</p>
<p><strong>Length 22 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Recall your childhood!
</code></pre>
<p>Popping an integer from a stack is done with this, as explained on snippet 12. When, per instance, Ophelia tells Hamlet the aforementioned sentence, it causes Hamlet to take an integer from his stack and assume that value.</p>
<p>Of course that, as long as the word <code>recall</code> is starting the sentence, you can fill in the rest with pretty much anything your creative shakesperian mind desires.</p>
<p><strong>Length 23 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Are you better than me?

<p>Implementation of snippet 6. When a &quot;character&quot; makes a question like this to another, what he/she is doing is equivalent to <code>if (x &gt; y)</code> on more common programming languages. The follow-up of this instruction must be delayed until I have more characters available.</p>

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Enter Romeo and Juliet]

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Let us return to scene II.

<p>Here it is, a <code>goto</code> in SPL, which works as one would expect in a programming language. A thing is: you can jump between scenes in the same act, and between acts; but you cannot jump between scenes in different acts.</p>
<p><strong>Length 27 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Exeunt Ophelia and Hamlet]
</code></pre>
<p>When more than one &quot;character&quot; leave the stage, instead of <code>Exit</code>, and keeping in tradition with SPL's theatrical nature, the latin word &quot;Exeunt&quot; is used. Sometimes it can be replaced just by snippet 8.</p>
<p><strong>Length 28 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Scene I: Ophelia's flattery.

<p>Declaring a Scene. As you can already expect if you've been coping with me, the important bit is the <code>Scene I</code>, the rest is artistic fluff.</p>
<p>There have been some compilers made (like <a href="https://github.com/drsam94/Spl" rel="noreferrer">this one that compiles from SPL to C, written in Python</a>) that instead refer to the text after the numbering of the Act/Scene. While more logical (after all, during a play, having the characters saying lines such as &quot;let us return to Act I&quot; may be deemed silly), I'm sticking to the original way.</p>
<p><strong>Length 29 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>You pretty little warm thing!
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, yet another constant (since we need <em>way more</em> characters to have arithmetic operations). This one is equal to <code>8</code>, because <code>2*2*2*1 = 8</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 30 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>You are as cowardly as Hamlet!

<p>Saying this to, per instance, Romeo, means that <code>Romeo = Hamlet</code>. Like snippet 9.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong> <em>(yes, another landmark reached!)</em></p>
<p>This language was created for an assignment in a Syntax Analysis course - thus, no SPL compiler was created by the authors. More: it seems SPL's authors have severed their ties with their creation, since nothing appears to have been modified in the language since 2001...</p>
<p><strong>Length 31 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>Am I as horrid as a flirt-gill?

<p>Yes, I know, it's somewhat repeating snippet 23, although, here, we're comparing the &quot;character&quot; who speaks with a &quot;flirt-gill&quot; (of, if you prefer, <code>if (Ophelia == -1)</code>). The thing is...</p>

<p>Ophelia asking this question to Hamlet means, translating this to a less readable programming language, <code>if (Hamlet &gt; the Ghost)</code>. It's snippet 23 all over again, yeah - but it goes to show you that it's not required to ask the &quot;characters&quot; if they are better than each other: any other question will work too.</p>

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>[Enter the Ghost, Romeo and the Ghost]

<p>Yes, I'm calling a &quot;character&quot; twice - because I wanted to have the program give me an error. Calling a &quot;character&quot; that's already on stage, or telling one that's absent to exit, will cause great grief to the parser/compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Length 39 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>the sum of a fat lazy pig and yourself!
</code></pre>
<p>The full instruction is more better looking that this, I'll give you that, but... here's our first arithmetic operation! What does it all mean, actually? Well, <code>pig</code> is a dirty animal (albeit tasty), so it's equivalent to <code>-1</code>, has two adjectives, meaning <code>fat lazy pig</code> equals <code>2*2*(-1) = -4</code>. But what about <code>yourself</code>? It's a reflexive pronoum, not a name nor an adjective. Well, remember that SPL is based on dialogues between &quot;characters&quot;; thus, <code>yourself</code> refers to the other &quot;character&quot; on stage. So, we arrive at the end and we discover that &quot;the sum of a fat lazy pig and yourself&quot; is, in fact, <code>-4 + x</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-spl prettyprint-override"><code>the sum of a squirrel and a white horse.

<h3>Factoid:</h3>

<p>Maple is a mathematical programming language and computation environment. However, the name “Maple” is not an acronym for Mathematical Programming Language, it’s a reference to its Canadian heritage.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu55" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html" rel="noreferrer">Piet</a></h1>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>

<p>Piet is a programming language where the source code consists of images. Program flow starts with the top-left pixel and moves around the image between pixels and pixel groups until it terminates.</p>

<p>For legibility, Piet programs are commonly displayed in an enlarged version. In such a case the term <code>codel</code> is used to describe a group of same-coloured pixels that correspond to an individual pixel in the source image.</p>

<p>For this challenge, since Piet does not use characters, one codel per vote will be used for sample programs.</p>

<p><strong>1 Codel</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/eB4XY.png" alt="1 Codel"></p>

<p>This is a valid program, it does nothing and terminates. The control flow starts in the top-left (only) pixel and has no way out, which ends the program.</p>

<p>The pixel can in this case be any colour for the exact same effect.</p>

<p><strong>2 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/lRG1h.png" alt="2 Codels"></p>

<p>This will continually read characters from stdin and keep a running total of their unicode values (though nothing is done with this total and it is not displayed).</p>

<p>Progam flow moves back and forth between the 2 codels, since the only way out of each one is into the other. Commands in piet are executed by movement from one codel or region into another, depending on the difference in hue and lightness of the 2 regions. The <code>input</code> is the command moving left-to-right and then the <code>add</code> is right-to-left. On the first <code>add</code> command, nothing will happen since there is only one value on the stack, and the specification says that commands without enough values available are ignored.</p>

<p>This program is a loop that will never end, as most piet programs will be at extremely small sizes, since it takes at least a few codels to properly "trap" the program flow and end it.</p>

<p><strong>3 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/rFVzV.png" alt="3 Codels"></p>

<p>This is a basic echo-type program, it will read a character at a time from stdin and print it to stdout.</p>

<p>Again this is an infinite loop. The program starts by travelling left-to right, which does the <code>input</code> then <code>output</code>. The program will continue to flow in the same direction whenever it can. At the light green codel the only exit is to start moving back the other way. When travelling back right-to-left it attempts to perform <code>subtract</code> and <code>add</code> commands, but the stack is empty so these become no-ops.</p>

<p><strong>4 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/m3XR2.png" alt="4 Codels"></p>

<p>Prints out 2 to stdout indefinitely.</p>

<p>Not a particularly interesting program functionally, but now that we finally have a composite number of codels we can show off slightly more advanced flow than left-to-right. When program flow attempts to exit a codel it first tries the current direction. If it's unable (in this case due to the edge of the image) it rotates 90 degrees clockwise and attempts to exit again. In this case, the program goes around clockwise 1 codel at a time, <code>push</code>ing 1 onto the stack twice, <code>add</code>ing the ones together, then <code>output</code>ing the result.</p>

<p><strong>5 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/nYWRF.png" alt="5 Codels"></p>

<p>Repeatedly reads a character at a time from stdin and tracks the sum of their unicode values.</p>

<p>This is essentially the same functionality as the 2-codel version, but this challenge is about showcasing the language, and one of the cool things about piet is how you can have different-looking pictures that do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here we see the white codel for the first time, which allows program flow to slide across it without executing instructions. The magenta and blue codels do all the work here. Travelling from blue to red does nothing because it crosses the white codel in the middle. The 2 red ones just <code>push</code> the number 1 onto the stack and <code>pop</code> it back off as it travels left-to-right then right-to-left across them, and then across the white codel so no instruction is executed.</p>

<p><strong>6 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/e8y5T.png" alt="6 Codels"></p>

<p>Again, repeating earlier functionality with a different look. This is another echo program that reads a character at a time from stdin to stdout.</p>

<p>Here we see our first black codel. Program flow cannot enter a black codel, so from the light magenta codel in the top-right the program will fail to exit right due to the image edge, fail to exit down due to the black codel, and bounce back left into the red codel. The blue and green codels are purely decorative, the program will never enter them.</p>

<p><strong>7 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/EnEqR.png" alt="7 Codels"></p>

<p>Yet another echo program with a different look.</p>

<p>Here we see our first codel blocks larger than size 1. In piet, any contiguous block of codels of the same colour is treated as a single block. The size of the block does not matter except when executing the <code>push</code> instruction, so this program is treated exactly like the 3-codel version, except with different colours.</p>

<p><strong>8 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/V9FYs.png" alt="8 Codels"></p>

<p>Reads a number from stdin and outputs the square to stdout, repeatedly.</p>

<p>Control flow is a basic clockwise pattern just as in the 4-codel program. Starting from the top-left, the operations in order are <code>input</code>, <code>duplicate</code> (pushes an extra copy of the top value of the stack onto the stack), <code>multiply</code>, <code>output</code>. Then it <code>push</code>es the value 1 onto the stack, slides across the white so no command is executed, and then <code>pop</code>s that 1 off of the stack when moving from the lower-left to upper-left codel. This returns it to the beginning of the program with an empty stack, and it repeats.</p>

<p><strong>9 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/yKnUm.png" alt="9 Codels"></p>

<p>Adds 1 + 2 = 3, and then terminates.</p>

<p>Now that we have a program with greater than 2 codels in both dimensions, we can finally set up a region that will trap the program and end it instead of looping forever. The first operation moving from the red codel to the dark red region is a <code>push</code> of 1, then the program rotates and flows down into the light red codel in the middle and <code>push</code>es a value of 2. Flowing from the light red to the light yellow executes an <code>add</code> operation. The bottom light yellow bar causes the program to end since there is no way for it to flow out as all the corners are blocked off.</p>

<hr>

<p>The 1- and 2-high programs are quickly becoming ugly and uninteresting so from this point on I'm going to focus on numbers that allow at least a few codels in each direction.</p>

<p><strong>12 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/uGZR7.png" alt="12 Codels"></p>

<p>Finally a program that does something that could be argued as useful (though it's still a bit of a stretch). Reads 2 numbers from stdin sequentially and then outputs their sum, and does this repeatedly.</p>

<p>Program flows left-to-right across the 4 coloured bars perfoming 2 <code>inputs</code> followed by an <code>add</code> command. It then moves into the lower-right codel and performs an <code>output</code>, and then goes left across the white region back to the start.</p>

<p>This could have been done in 8 codels, but since we have the extra space we can make something that's a little bit inspired by an old no-signal TV display.</p>

<p><strong>15 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/OjV6N.png" alt="15 Codels"></p>

<p>Reads a number from stdin and outputs its' square.</p>

<p>This uses a couple of tricks to get a bit of a symmetrical look to a program that actually does something. The leftmost red bar is a different colour on the bottom codel than the rest, taking advantage of the fact that (for me at least) these 2 shades of red look very similar. the program will move from the lighter red region right into the light blue codel, and then straight across the middle of the program to the light green on the right side where it is trapped. It performs <code>input</code>, <code>duplicate</code>, <code>multiply</code>, and <code>output</code> operations.</p>

<p>The darker red codel, along with the medium green codels on the top and bottom of the middle column, are decorative and the program will never reach them.</p>

<p><strong>20 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/IiXez.png" alt="20 Codels"></p>

<p>Reads numbers from stdin until a 0 is read, at which point it outputs the sum of all entered numbers and exits.</p>

<p>We finally have enough room to do control flow in the form of the <code>pointer</code> operation. The 4 codels along the top perform <code>input</code>, <code>duplicate</code>, and <code>not</code> operations, and then another <code>not</code> operation moving from the magenta in the top-right to the 2-codel yellow below it. The <code>not</code> operation pops the top value off of the stack and pushes a 1 if the top value was a 0, and a 1 otherwise. Therefore a double-<code>not</code> replaces any nonzero value with a 1. Moving from the yellow bar down to the dark blue performs a <code>pointer</code> operation, which pops the top value off of the stack and moves the direction pointer clockwise that many times.</p>

<p>If the top value is a 1 (i.e. we didn't enter a zero) the direction pointer will point left, moving to the magenta codels for an <code>add</code> operation (which will be ignored the first time due to only one value on the stack) and then through the white back to the start of the program.</p>

<p>If the top value of the stack is a zero at the pointer operation, the direction pointer will not change and the program will continue downwards. Moving into the lighter blue band will <code>pop</code> the 0 that was entered off of the stack, leaving only the sum of the accumulated numbers. Moving into the cyan bar on the bottom will <code>output</code> that sum, and then end since the program flow is trapped.</p>

<p><strong>25 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/BQKEu.png" alt="25 Codels"></p>

<p>Countdown! Reads a number from stdin, and then prints a countdown to 1 to stdout one number at a time. For example, if 5 is read, will print 54321.</p>

<p>The first operation from cyan to yellow is the <code>input</code>. Then the yellow is where the program "loop" starts. Yellow > Magenta > Blue is a <code>duplicate</code> then an <code>output</code>, so it prints the top value on the stack but keeps a copy. Moving down the right side, we <code>push</code> the value 1 onto the stack then perform a <code>subtraction</code>, decreasing our entered value by 1. Next is <code>duplicate</code>, <code>not</code>, and another <code>not</code> moving from the light magenta in the bottom-right to the dark yellow beside it. This is the same zero/nonzero check as the previous program. Moving left into the light blue codel performs a <code>pointer</code> operation, that will either move left into the dark cyan to end the program if we're done, or up to the yellow to re-start our loop without the initial input but the original value decreased by 1.</p>

<p>All 3 of the red codels are decorative and could be any colour.</p>

<p><strong>30 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/gVE3q.png" alt="30 Codels"></p>

<p>Fibonacci generator. Prints out terms of the Fibonacci sequence to stdout and doesn't stop.</p>

<p>This is the first introduction of the <code>roll</code> operator, as well as the first time that a region size bigger than 1 is used with the <code>push</code> operator to get a specific value onto the stack.</p>

<p>As always starts in the top-left moving right. The first 2 operations <code>push</code> a 1 onto the stack and then <code>output</code> it since the Fibonacci sequence starts with two 1s, but the main program loop will only print 1 once. Then it <code>push</code>es 2 more 1s onto the stack to end up in the dark magenta in the top-right to start the main program loop.</p>

<p>Moving down the right side we <code>duplicate</code> and <code>output</code> to print off the next term of the sequence, then <code>duplicate</code> again to get a copy of the current sequence value. Moving left across the bottom executes 2 <code>push</code> operations. Since the light red region in the bottom-right is 3 codels in size, the first <code>push</code> will push a 3 onto the stack instead of a 1.</p>

<p>Moving up into the light blue is a <code>roll</code> operation. This pops the top 2 values off of the stack and performs a number of rolls equal to the first value popped, to a depth equal to the second value popped. In this case, it will perform 1 roll to a depth of 3. A roll to depth <code>n</code> takes the top value of the stack (our duplicated current value) and buries it <code>n</code> places deep. Our stack is only 3 deep right now so it will bury the top value at the bottom.</p>

<p>Moving up once more performs an <code>add</code> operation adding together the current sequence value with the previous sequence value. Our stack now has the next (new current) sequence value on top, and the last value below it. The program now moves right across the white into the dark magenta to start the loop again.</p>

<p>The yellow pattern in the middle is never used.</p>

<p><strong>54 Codels</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/H7qdd.png" alt="54 Codels"></p>

<p>Prints "hi!" to stdout</p>

<p>Not a particularly long message, but printing in piet takes a surprising amount of room. Printing is done by using unicode values, and integers are pushed onto the stack by using the size of the region that is being exited. Since we have a very limited number of codels for this challenge, we use some math to get up to the printable range we want.</p>

<p>The program starts with a <code>push</code> of 5 from the cyan region on the left. From here, it flows right along the top with 6 <code>duplicate</code> operations to prime the stack with a bunch of 5s. Next is <code>push</code> 1, <code>subtract</code> to put a 4 on top of the stack, then 2 <code>multiply</code> operations to put 4*5*5=100 on top of the stack. Then a <code>duplicate</code> for 2 100s.</p>

<p>Now the program bounces off of the black and starts working leftwards along the bottom. <code>Push</code> operations of 3 and 2 and then a <code>roll</code> to bury the 2 100s under a 5. Next is <code>push</code> 1, subtract, and add to get 100+5-1=104 on top of the stack, which is unicode "h". Next 2 operations are <code>push</code> 1 and <code>pointer</code> to get around the corner and start moving right along the middle, and then <code>output</code> to print "h".</p>

<p>Next is <code>add</code> 100+5=105 on top of the stack, and <code>output</code> to print "i". The stack now contains two 5s. <code>Push</code> 1, <code>add</code>, <code>multiply</code> gives (1+5)*5=30. Finally <code>push</code> 3 and <code>add</code> for 33, and <code>output</code> for the trailing "!". The program then goes right through the remaining white space to end in the green on the right.</p>

<div id="pu56" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://bitbucket.org/zacharyjtaylor/my-language/src" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MY</a></h1>

<p>MY currently has no implemented codepage, so code will be listed in both bytes and the unimplemented codepage, one following the other. MY is stack based and "vector oriented" (like Jelly, some commands automatically "vecify" over their arguments). MY also has an "Object Subject Verb" visual order of commands.</p>

<h2>1 byte</h2>

<pre><code>27
↵
</code></pre>

<p>This program outputs <code>0</code> with a trailing newline. MY does not have implicit input nor implicit output, if one pops from an empty stack, it pops 0. </p>

<h2>2 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>1F 27
⍞↵
</code></pre>

<p>This program takes a line of raw input, then outputs it (with a trailing newline). MY can't do very much in 1 or 2 bytes due to lack of implicit IO.</p>

<h2>3 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>1F 64 27
⍞h↵
</code></pre>

<p>Reads a line from STDIN, then converts it from hexadecimal (must be uppercase) to an integer. This <strong>beats Jelly</strong>.</p>

<h2>4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>01 02 81 26
12-←
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the quirk of MY comes in, for multiple argument commands, MY pops the amount of arguments needed, then applies them to a function in the <strong>order that they are popped</strong>. OSV, this resembles (hence, the <code>Y</code> standing for <code>Yoda</code>). Thus, the above code outputs <code>1</code>  rather than <code>-1</code> (<em>without</em> a trailing newline).</p>

<h2>5 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>01 4D 02 80 26
1W2+←
</code></pre>

<p>This showcases MY's "vector orientation". This differs from APL and J, but is more like Jelly's concept of vectorizing ("vecifying" in MY). The program pushes 1 to the stack, wraps that in an array, pushes 2 to the stack, adds the top two elements, then displays with no newline (outputting <code>[3]</code> due to the "vecification" of commands).</p>

<div id="pu57" class="pu"><h1>Casio-BASIC</h1>

<p>Casio BASIC is very unlike TI-BASIC; firstly, it doesn't require as much RAM, memory or power. Programs typically only use a few KB of RAM. Secondly, it allows scrolling through the list of functions to write a program, or the use of special buttons which insert common characters. However, unlike TI-BASIC, functions can simply be typed in letter by letter from the keyboard.</p>

<div id="pu59" class="pu"><h2>TeX</h2>

<p>TeX was the first language to get its own StackExchange site.</p>

<p>(Note that we will show examples in plain TeX mostly; if any example is to be compiled using LaTeX, it will be clearly stated.)</p>

<h2>10 <code>cuff\/link</code></h2>

<p>TeX works well with  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ligatures</a> such as <code>ff</code>, <code>fl</code>, <code>ffl</code> or <code>fi</code> by default, i.e., it takes the correct ligature glyph from the font automatically. This is in general welcome of course, however, in some cases, it is frowned upon, such as in compound words. Compare the following two renderings of the word <em>cufflink</em>, the first one proper (ligature broken on the compound word boundary) and the second one improper (ligature crossing the compound word boundary). The first one is achieved by adding <code>\/</code> in the code in the correct place.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/5MC9e.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<h2>9 <code>\badness0</code></h2>

<p>Yes, in TeX, you can define how "bad" things are :-) Well, actually, badness inserted in a paragraph of text says how bad it is if a linebreak appeared at the specific place. Some things insert their own badnesses; for instance, it is worse to hyphenate words than not to, and the non-breaking space has badness of 10000, which is, in a sense, the infinite badness in TeX's eyes. Here, we set the badness to zero. We also see that assignments in plain TeX are done by concatenating the register (<code>\badness</code> here) and the value; optionally we can place the equals sign in between.</p>

<p>Actually, the concept of penalties (badnesses) is crucial for TeX; it's a typographic system and beauty is one of the goals, and Knuth designed TeX so that only deterministic algorithms are used to break paragraphs into lines and lines into pages, to ensure at least reasonable stability.</p>

<h2>8 <code>\def\x{}</code></h2>

<p>Simple definition. This defines a macro ("control sequence" in proper words) which does not take an argument and expands to ... well ... nothing :) (Do not be confused: "nothing" is not "relax", they substantially different.)</p>

<h2>7 <code>$$a+b$$</code> or <code>\[a+b\]</code></h2>

<p>Two snippets that <em>somehow</em> produce the same output, it's a displayed equation showing simple </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>a</em> + <em>b</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(just centred of course). The first is the correct thing to do in plain TeX. If only people knew how wrong it is in LaTeX, where the second one should be used!</p>

<h2>6 <code>\relax</code></h2>

<p>TeX is one of the languages that have its own "do nothing" action. However, <code>\relax</code> is more than just that, and this is related to the fact that it is an <em>expansion language</em>: All macros are expanded, and in some contexts, executed. The power of <code>\relax</code> is that it is executed to nothing, but it cannot be expanded, i.e., it survives any expansion unmodified. This in turn is one of the strenghts (and threats at the same time, especially for newcomers) of TeX.</p>

<h2>5 <code>X\bye</code></h2>

<p>A minimal document that compiles producing an output; we get a page with a 10-point "X" at the top and a centred page number "1" at the bottom. <em>... "X," said Tom, and added, leaving: "Bye!"</em></p>

<h2>4 <code>\bye</code></h2>

<p>When you say "bye" to TeX, it finishes the document; namely it closes the current paragraph if any is open, ships out the last page, and ends. Without this command, no document can be successfully produced.</p>

<h2>3 <code>$a$</code></h2>

<p>Prints the mathematical symbol "a", that can stand for instance for a variable, function or a constant. Without the dollars, it would be the text symbol "a"; it is necessary to distinguish these two!</p>

<h2>2 <code>&lt;endline&gt;&lt;endline&gt;</code></h2>

<p>Two consecutive ends of line finish a paragraph. (One end of line behaves like a space.)</p>

<h2>1 <code>%</code></h2>

<p>The percent sign starts a comment; the comment runs until the end of line, and eats the end of line together with leading whitespace on the next line.</p>

<li>Decimal was on <a href="//tio.run/#Decimal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tio.run</a> from day 1 of its release.</li>
<li>Decimal is not based on the top of the stack. It's based on a Default Stack Index (DSI). All functions that write to the stack set this index.</li>
<li>While very obfuscated, Decimal can be easily translated into pseudo-stack code.</li>
<li>All characters other than <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> and <code>D</code> are simply printed as they appear in the source code. This excludes whitespace.</li>

<div id="pu62" class="pu"><h1>Haskell</h1>

<p>
You might want to read from the bottom up. Sometimes I refer back to lower snippets, but never to higher ones, so it might help understanding.</p>

<p>Readers who do not know Haskell: am I clear? When am I not clear? I can't tell.</p>

<h1>Length 86 snippet</h1>

<p>A foldable instance for our tree data structure (snippet 23).
Foldable is a type class - as in, a class(/group) of types. These are parallel to interfaces in Java. They essentially generalize over types, unifying types which have common characteristics; for example, they can be added together (<code>Monoid</code>), containers (<code>Functor</code>), can be printed as text (<code>Show</code>, which we have met already, in the <code>show</code> function), and so on.
This one unifies data types which are list-like in that they can be iterated over or flattened to a list.</p>

<p>In this snippet, we define the instance by defining <code>foldr</code>, which essentially iterates over the data type from right to left. Now, we can use a bunch of general pre-written code. First, we define a helper function to get a singleton tree, to avoid all the clutter: <code>s a = N E a E</code>. Now:</p>

<pre><code>sum (N (s 3) 7 (N E 5 (s 8))     === 23
product (N (s 3) 7 (N E 5 (s 8)) === 840
toList (N (s 3) 7 (N E 5 (s 8))  === [3,7,5,8]
</code></pre>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of our tree:</p>

<pre><code>7
| \
3  5
    \
     8
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 70 snippet</h1>

<pre><code>primes=sieve[2..] where
 sieve(p:xs)=p:sieve(filter(\x-&gt;x`mod`p/=0)xs)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a prime sieve!</p>

<p>(note: <code>/=</code> is what <code>!=</code> is in other languages)</p>

<p>This works by defining a function <code>sieve</code> which filters the list and keeps only the numbers which are not divisible by any previous prime. It is defined recursively - to <code>sieve</code> is defined as to split the list to a first element <code>p</code> and a tail, filter from the tail any number divisible by <code>p</code>, <code>sieve</code> the remaining bit, attach <code>p</code> to the start of that, and return.</p>

<p>Again, we are working with infinite lists here - but the computation will halt in time as long as you don't require an infinite amount of primes to be computed.</p>

<pre><code>take 4 primes === [2,3,5,7]
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 68 snippet</h1>

<p>Finally, a quine!</p>

<pre><code>main=do putStr s;print s where s="main=do putStr s;print s where s="
</code></pre>

<p>In your first time reading this, you might think that the output of this quine would be missing the quotation marks, and why would you once write <code>putStr</code> and once <code>print</code>? It sounds the same.</p>

<p>In Haskell, <code>putStr</code> is a function that just prints the contents of the string it gets to stdout; <code>print</code>, though, prints things to stdout.
So, <code>print 4</code> is equivalent to <code>putStr "4\n"</code>, but <code>putStr 4</code> is nonsensical - <code>4</code> is not a string!
So, when <code>print</code> gets a value, it first converts it into a string, and then prints that string. Generally the way to convert things to strings is to find the way you would write it down in code. So, the way you would write the string <code>abc</code> in a string in Haskell code is <code>"abc"</code>, so <code>print "abc"</code> actually prints <code>"abc"</code>, not <code>abc</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 33 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>main=go 0
go n=do print n;go(n+1)
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing to note is that we didn't use a loop. Haskell doesn't loop. Haskell recurses. Haskell doesn't have loops. It's deeper than that: <b>Haskell doesn't even have Control flow</b>.
How, you might ask? Well, it doesn't need any.</p>

<p>On with the details.
This program prints an infinite increasing sequence of integers, starting from 0.
<code>go</code> prints them starting with its input, then <code>main</code> calls it on <code>0</code>.</p>

<p><code>do</code> is a special syntactic power of Haskell. In this scenario, it just combines I/O actions, just like <code>&gt;&gt;</code> does (see snippet 22).</p>

<h1>Length 26 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>map f=foldr(\x y-&gt;f x:y)[]
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the <code>map</code> function, probably familiar to everyone, using <code>foldr</code>.
Notice that although we didn't declare <code>map</code>'s type, the computer somehow knows its type is <code>(a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]</code>, i.e. given a function from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>, and a list of <code>a</code>s, return a list of <code>b</code>s.</p>

<p>How did it know?? ;-)</p>

<h1>Length 25 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>main=putStr"Hello World"
</code></pre>

<p>The standard Hello World. Note the types: <code>main</code> has type of <code>IO ()</code> and <code>putStr</code> has type of <code>String -&gt; IO ()</code> (a function from strings to I/O actions which return nothing).</p>

<h1>Length 23 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>data T a=E|N(T a)a(T a)

<p>This is a standard definition of a Tree. How much easier than all those lines required to define a tree in Java, C, or anything else.</p>

<p>(see snippet 10)</p>

<p>Let's break it down:</p>

<p><code>data</code> - this declaration declares a data type.
<code>T a</code> - a tree containing elements of type <code>a</code>. This is the type we are defining.
<code>=</code> - every value of <code>T a</code> will be any of the following, separated by a pipe <code>|</code>.
<code>E</code> - one of the possible values of <code>T s</code> - the empty tree.
<code>N (T a) a (T a)</code> - the other possible value of a tree - a node. Each node consists of the left child (<code>(T a)</code>) the element (<code>a</code>) and the right child (<code>(T a)</code>).</p>

<pre><code>main=putStrLn"y"&gt;&gt;main
</code></pre>

<p>A Haskell <code>yes</code> function.
<code>&gt;&gt;</code> is an operator which combines and sequences two I/O actions. It has type of <code>&gt;&gt; :: IO a -&gt; IO b -&gt; IO b</code>.</p>

<p><code>main</code> is defined recursively by itself, as the I/O action which first prints <code>"y"</code> and then does whatever <code>main</code> itself does.</p>

<pre><code>fix f=r where r=f r
</code></pre>

<p>A better definition for <code>fix</code>. (See snippet 14.)
The problem with the first definition, <code>fix f = f(fix f)</code>, is that every time we call <code>fix f</code> <code>fix</code> recalls <code>fix f</code>, which recalls <code>fix f</code>, generating endless copies of the same computation. This version fixes it by defining <code>r</code> (result) to be the result; as such, <code>f r = r</code>. So, let's define <code>r = f r</code>. Now we return <code>r</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 17 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>f n=product[1..n]
</code></pre>

<p>This is the functional way to define factorial.</p>

<h1>Length 16 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>f n=(\x-&gt;x+x+x)n
</code></pre>

<p><code>(\x -&gt; x + x + x)</code> is a lambda (someone thought <code>\</code> resembles the letter.).</p>

<p><code>(\x -&gt; x + x + x) n</code> is the lambda applied to <code>n</code> (this is exactly the same as <code>n + n + n</code>).</p>

<p><code>f</code> is the multiply-by-three function (also <code>f = (*3)</code>)</p>

<h1>Length 15 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>sum=foldl (+) 0
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the <code>sum</code> function using a fold. A fold is basically a loop over the elements of a list with one accumulator.<br>
<code>foldl</code> takes as arguments some function <code>f</code> and some initial value <code>x</code> for the accumulator and a list <code>xs</code>. The function <code>f</code> should get as input the previous accumulator value and the current value of the list, and it returns the next accumulator.<br>
Then the fold iterates on the list values, applying <code>f</code> on the previous accumulator, and then returns the last accumulator.</p>

<p>Another way to think about folds is like the fold 'inserts' <code>f</code> between the list values and with the initial accumulator in one of the sides. For example, <code>foldl (*) 1 [4,2,5]</code> evaluates to <code>1 * 4 * 2 * 5</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 14 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>fix f=f(fix f)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>y</code> combinator. It is usually named <code>fix</code> because it finds the fixpoint of the equation <code>f x = x</code>. Note that <code>x = infinite loop</code> can also sometimes a solution, so <code>fix (\x -&gt; x^2 + 5*x + 7)</code> won't solve the equation <code>x^2 + 4*x + 7 = 0</code> but instead return an infinite loop.</p>

<p>You may also note that not always <code>x = infinite loop</code> is a solution, because of Haskell's laziness.</p>

<p>This version is a time and space leak; we will redefine it in a longer snippet.</p>

<h1>Length 13 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>f=sum.map(^2)
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the <b>function</b> <code>f</code> that given a list returns the sum of its squares. It is the <b>function</b> composition of the <b>function</b> <code>sum</code> and the <b>function</b><code>map(^2)</code>, which in turn is the <b>function</b> <code>map</code> applied to the <b>function</b> <code>(^2)</code> (the <i>square</i> <b>function</b>), which is in turn a section of the <b>function</b> <code>^</code> (sections were introduced at snippet 2, and composition at snippet 3).</p>

<p>As you can see, <b>functions</b> are quite important in a <b>functional</b> language like Haskell. In fact, it has been said that Haskell is the language with the most standard library <b>functions</b> which get <b>functions</b> as inputs or return <b>functions</b> as outputs (this is commonly known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function" rel="noreferrer">higher-order <b>function</b></a>.</p>

<p>By the way, technically, every two-or-more argument <b>function</b> is a function which returns <b>functions</b> as outputs (this is called currying).</p>

<h1>Length 10 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>data B=T|F
</code></pre>

<p>This is a definition of Haskell booleans with different names. The boolean type is named <code>B</code>.<br> This definition introduces two constructors: true (<code>T</code>) and false (<code>F</code>).<br>
This code snippet basically tells the compiler that every boolean (<code>B</code>) is either true (<code>T</code>) or false (<code>F</code>), or in other words, <code>B=T|F</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, all data types ever can be defined in Haskell, when in other languages the number, references and array data types need special support from the compiler. In practice there is special support in Haskell as it would be very inconvenient otherwise, but for example the <code>Bool</code> datatype is defined entirely in language.</p>

<h1>Length 9 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>main=main
</code></pre>

<p>This nonsensical program will define <code>main</code> to be main. Because Haskell is lazy, values which would require an infinite loop to evaluate can be used freely if we don't use their actual value. Such values which contain infinite loops, like our <code>main</code>, are called "bottoms".</p>

<p>A fun fact is that the GHC Haskell compiler can detect these kinds of infinite loops and throw a catchable (!) exception when it is run.</p>

<h1>Length 8 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>f(x:_)=x
</code></pre>

<p>This defines the function <code>f</code> which, given a non-empty list, will return its head.</p>

<p>Patterns in Haskell are like Python's sequence unpacking, but generalized for all types. Patterns can either reject or match a value, and if it matches, can bind variables to values.</p>

<p>The patterns in this snippet are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>_</code>: the pattern which matches anything and binds no variable.</li>
<li><code>x</code>: the pattern which bind anything and binds it to the variable <code>x</code>.</li>
<li><code>:</code>: this pattern gets to child patterns, that is, one for the head, and one for the tail. If the list is non empty, it matches them with the head and the tail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pattern matching is highly generalized. In fact, just defining new data types will automatically introduce patterns for working with them.</p>

<h1>Length 5 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>x=2:x
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa, there's so much to explain on this one.</p>

<p>First of all, Haskell is lazy. This means that subexpressions will be evaluated only when strictly necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this code snippet doesn't show assignment, but definition. Haskell doesn't have assignment.</p>

<p>This code snippet defined <code>x</code>, an infinite list made up entirely of <code>2</code>. Usually in other languages <code>x</code> has to be evaluated before <code>2:x</code> can ever be evaluated, but in Haskell we can do this.</p>

<p>Haskell infinite lists are sort of a mix of iterators and regular linked lists: they act like both (an iteration over a range will use constant memory, for example).</p>

<h1>Length 4 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>2:[]
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet just encodes the singleton list <code>[2]</code>.
<code>:</code> is the <em>Cons</em> operator in Haskell. In fact, the regular list syntax is just syntactic sugar for the cons operator and the empty list literal. This tightly ties in into the way Haskell deals with Pattern matching and Data types (particularly the concept of constructor).</p>

<h1>Length 3 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>f.g
</code></pre>

<p>In Haskell, <code>.</code> stands for function composition. Haskell can be written in a "point-free" style, which is characterized by not naming function arguments and instead using the <code>.</code> operator to manipulate data flow.</p>

<h1>Length 2 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>1-
</code></pre>

<p>When this code is wrapped in parentheses (for syntactical reasons) it is called a "section". It is then a function that given some number, "fills up" the empty spot and returns one minus that number. This notion is sometimes useful in a functional language like Haskell, where otherwise a lambda would be needed.</p>

<h1>Length 1 snippet:</h1>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>In Haskell, <code>1</code> can be both an <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Word</code> and so forth. In fact, you can write code to define a version of <code>1</code> in any type and use it freely.<br>
this is done too in JavaScript, Python and so forth, but unlike those, it is done with full type safety.</p>

<h1>factoid:</h1>

<p>Originally, the Haskell committee intended to call the language "Curry" after Haskell B. Curry's name but decided to change the name to Haskell because some puns might arise. Only later they noticed Haskell's similarity to "Pascal" and "Hassle"!</p>

<div id="pu63" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://codepen.io/programmer5000/pen/zwYrVd" rel="noreferrer">CGL (CGL Golfing Language)</a></h1>

<p><sub>(or Code Golf Language, this was not intentional :)</sub></p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>CGL uses the stack concept like a lot of other golfing languages, but unlike them it has an infinite number of stacks that it has. Most operators operate on the current stack except some that change the current stack or move things. Stacks have numerical indexes. 0 is the default stack. The <code>-1</code>th stack is where input is stored.</p>

<p>I am unsure how bytes are counted for some of this unicode, so feel free to correct me in comments.</p>

<h2>1 byte</h2>

<pre><code>h
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs <code>Hello, World!</code>. Actually pushes <code>Hello, World!</code> to the current stack (default <code>0</code>) and the first element in the current stack is outputted by default. </p>

<h2>2 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>-²
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of possible 2 byte programs, but I wanted to show a cool operator in this one: <code>-</code>. <code>-</code> decrements the current stack, in this case switching from <code>0</code> (default) to <code>-1</code> (where input is stored). <code>²</code> squares the current stack. The first item in the current stack is outputted by default, so this squares the input and returns it.</p>

<h2>3 bytes (uses a combining character)</h2>

<pre><code>'҄҄낄䀀
</code></pre>

<p>This shows off the neat string compressing function. Normally, you wrap a string in <code>"</code>s and it is pushed to the current stack. <code>'</code>s enable you to use compressed strings. <code>҄낄䀀</code> is the compressed version of <code>Hi!</code> (note in this example, there is no compression savings, but with longer strings there often is. Also, you can use <code>&amp;</code> to compress the current stack.) Quotes are auto-completed if you leave them off.</p>

<h2>4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>-#2➕
</code></pre>

<p>Adds 2 to the input. <code>➕</code> adds the second stack item to the first or <code>1</code> to the first if the second stack item is non-existent.</p>

<h2>5 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>-#1＋Ⓧ
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>#</code> pushes the following number to the stack. Note that technically numbers are <em>wrapped</em> in #s, but if you leave them off they will be added between the last digit and any non-number character. The <code>＋</code> (diffrent from <code>+</code>) adds the first 2 stack items and pushes that to the stack. <code>Ⓧ</code> outputs the last item from the stack and exits. This therefore adds 1 to the input.</p>

<div id="pu64" class="pu"><h1>C – <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/posts/44698/edit">edit</a></h1>

<p>Thanks for the votes! When compared to other languages and what they can do in limited bytes, C looks obsolete, fussy and too dependent on the developer. In many ways it is: scripted and higher level languages with automatic memory management are much more expressive and quicker to production than C will ever be.</p>
<p>So why feature C?</p>
<p>The hidden secret behind all those scripting languages is that the interpreters are likely written in C (or more recently, C++ or Java). The first C++ compilers actually compiled to C code. In fact, until there's a market for a direct compiler, it's usually more cost effective to write a compiler to generate C, and then compile that.</p>
<p>If you're working on very small platforms, maybe even without an operating system available, you're likely working in C. These days, just about every appliance has a microcontroller embedded in it, no doubt programmed in C. When they need it small and fast, C is the way to go. (Also FORTH, for the masochists.)</p>
<p>Knowing C takes you as close to the metal as you can go without getting into assembler, and helps you in other languages. You have a good idea how a C++ virtual function probably works. You know when you write those pass-by-value recursive functions in PHP, that internally it's doing a lot of memory allocation and copying, so you instinctively try out pass-by-reference. Callbacks and references don't freak out C developers, maybe Haskell does though.</p>
<p>As Kernighan and Ritchie mentioned in their preface of the classic <em>C Programming Language</em>, 2nd edition, <em>C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.</em> I'm trying to follow this advice: examples do double, triple or more duty if possible.</p>
<p>All the snippets are at least compilable on their own. Those that are linkable and executable are indicated as such. I know this isn't a requirement, but it makes it simpler than trying to explain the framework required to make any code snippet work.</p>
<p>I also tried to make sure each code snippet was as short as possible so that I'm not introducing extra spaces just to pad to a certain length. In cases where code is indented, the indents are not included in the length, just one character for each new line.</p>

<p>C, being an older programming language, has gone through several iterations. The earliest in widespread use was developed by Kernighan and Ritchie and abbreviated K&amp;R. K&amp;R C is notable for making a lot of assumptions about your code if you don't explicitly provide them.</p>
<p>In particular, in K&amp;R C, the code above is assumed to be a global integer <code>x</code> initialized to 0. Compiling it in K&amp;R mode will produce an object file which provides any program linking to it this variable for its use.</p>

<p>C is so widespread that it needs to provide compatibility features for systems which do not have all the characters it uses. The above is a trigraph for the backslash, which is used in C as a line continuation character. The above will compile, likely with a warning that there isn't a line following.</p>
<p>A common culture in C is to ignore compilation warnings, and many large code bases invariably have a few or more warnings when they're being built.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>f();

<p>Again with K&amp;R, the above is &quot;filled out&quot; to mean upon compilation that &quot;There exists, with global linkage, a function <code>f</code>, to be provided later, which takes a fixed but unspecified number of arguments and returns an integer.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>s=&quot;&quot;;

<p>K&amp;R C is notable for being truly forgiving. Upon compilation, this code will provide an integer <code>s</code> for global linkage which is initialized to the starting address of an empty string (I think). K&amp;R quietly handles all the coercions, including truncation if an integer isn't large enough to hold the address.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>f(){f;}

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>#define Z

<p>A mainstay of C header files is the <code>#define</code> preprocessor directive. C programs compile in various stages, and in one of these stages these definitions are substituted with their actual values.</p>
<p>When an argument is missing, C will imply <code>1</code>, so the above would substitute <code>1</code> wherever <code>Z</code> is used in the source code.</p>

<p>There are numerous conventions in C, and one of these is how to represent infinite loops. In this case, <code>for(;;)</code> indicates no initialization, no exit check which defaults to 1 meaning true - i.e. don't break, and no looping code.</p>
<p>Sometime it's possible to do everything inside of the <code>()</code> and the loop itself needs no body. In this case a dummy semicolon is added at the end.</p>

<p>Arrays in C do not need the lengths specified. The empty square brackets <code>[]</code> tell the compiler to &quot;figure it out yourself&quot;.

<p>The <code>!!</code> convention is often used to coerce an integer from non-zero and zero to 1 and 0 respectively. Many C developers like to use these kinds of tricks (often at odds of those who value code clarity).</p>
<p>Super keen C developers can confirm that the above will work on ones-complement and signed hardware. For those wondering, you're almost certain to be working on twos-complement hardware right now. Only the really lucky (or unlucky depending on your perspective) need to worry about this!</p>

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>#include&lt;complex.h&gt;
double complex c=3.0+I*4.0;
</code></pre>
<p>C99 includes support for complex numbers. As you can see from the code, it takes the form of a modifier for a real type. You could also use <code>int complex c=3+I*4;</code> but internally it coerces to a floating point type. The above code will compile in gcc using <code>gcc -std=c99 -c length-48.c</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to see more of the internals, try compiling with the -E switch. For my version of gcc, the declaration above becomes <code>double _Complex c=3.0+(__extension__ 1.0iF)*4.0;</code>. Note that the complex type is a significant addition to the language, not just a few cheap macros.</p>
<p>This is just a teaser, when we get to more than 125 characters, then we can start having some real fun with complex numbers!</p>

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
main(){double d=sqrt(sin(3.2));}
</code></pre>
<p>For various reasons, C doesn't automatically link to the standard mathematical functions such as sin, cos, tan, sqrt, etc. So if they're used, but not linked, the developer will be presented with the linker error <strong>undefined reference to 'sqrt'</strong>, or some other error.</p>
<p>In gcc, the code above will compile and link using <code>gcc length-51.c -lm</code>.</p>
<p>Note <code>sin(3.2)</code> will return a negative number, of which the square root is not legal in the real domain. In C, a special value <code>NaN</code> is returned to indicate this error, which the program is free to ignore!</p>
<p>In C99, there are a lot of new exception handling functions to provide very safe and fine-grained control of these kinds of math errors, which just about nobody uses!</p>

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int w;static int X(int x){static int s=0;s^=x;return s;}
</code></pre>
<p>Or formatted more sanely:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int w;
static int X(int x)
{
    static int s=7;
    s^=x;
    return s;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you might have guessed, this is all about the keyword <code>static</code> which has more than one meaning in C.</p>
<p>In the first two cases, <code>static</code> is telling the compiler that integer <code>w</code> and function <code>X</code> are not visible outside of this file or compilation unit, i.e. they are internal.</p>
<p>These functions are not intended to be called externally, so they might not check the arguments for validity, and cut other corners. Because they have internal scope, you can redefine <code>w</code> and <code>X</code> in other files, and they will usually be separate.</p>
<p>In the last case, <code>static</code> indicates that the integer <code>s</code> retains its value between function calls. The first time <code>X</code> is called, <code>s</code> will be its initial value <code>7</code>, when it is exclusive-ORed with <code>x</code>, the new value will be retained.</p>
<p>Internally, although it is implementation dependent, the usual memory organization is that <code>s</code> is residing on the heap, specifically initialized memory, while the argument <code>x</code> is residing on the stack. Where variables reside is important if you want to implement recursive algorithms, for example.</p>
<p>A gotcha in C are clashes with global variables. Until <code>w</code> and <code>X</code> are actually defined as <code>static</code>, if they are defined globally somewhere, then <code>w</code> and <code>X</code> will refer to the global entities instead.</p>
<p>Here <code>q</code> and <code>w</code> may not be initialized to the same value, because a global <code>w</code> is being used to set <code>q</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int q = w;
static int w;
</code></pre>
<p>If a global <code>w</code> doesn't exist, the compilation should fail.</p>
<p>Here <code>q</code> and <code>w</code> will be initialized to the same value:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>static int w;
static int q = w;
</code></pre>
<p>Typically, designers will reduce name clashes by adding a distinctive prefix or suffix to their global variables and functions.</p>
<p>In C99, <code>static</code> has gained another use, e.g. <code>int Y(int a[static 10]);</code> which means that there is a function <code>Y</code> which takes an array of <em>at least</em> 10 integers.</p>
<p><strong>Length 74 snippet</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>void f(register int*p,register int*q,register int l){while(l--)*p++=*q++;}
</code></pre>
<p>Or laid out nicely:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>void f(register int *p, register int *q, register int l)
{
    while (l--)
        *p++ = *q++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code>register</code> provides a hint to the compiler that using hardware registers would be beneficial here. The above function will copy <code>l</code> integers from <code>q</code> to <code>p</code>, using hardware registers if possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes the speedups could be significant. For example, in the 68K microprocessor family, the line <code>*p++ = *q++</code> could be translated to a single instruction <code>MOVE.W (Ap)+,(Aq)+</code> vs. six or eight if you didn't use <code>register</code>. The 68K microprocessor had explicit post-increment and pre-decrement modes, so the savvy developer, if he knew the platform, would tailor code by using <code>x++</code> and <code>--y</code> vs. <code>++x</code> and <code>y--</code>.</p>
<p>These days compilers mostly ignore <code>register</code>, other than not allowing addresses to be taken of them (e.g. in the above <code>&amp;l</code> would cause a compiler error).</p>

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int f(int x)
{
    return (x &gt; 1)? x * f(x - 1): 1;
}

int main()
{
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, f(12));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, recursion! The snippet is a complete program to compile, link and run. The function <code>f</code> calculates the factorial of its argument <code>x</code> by using the recursive formula f(x) = x * f(x - 1). Factorials get big really quickly, so for example <code>f(12)</code> is the largest value you can get in a signed 32-bit integer.</p>
<p>For an example of <strong>really</strong> recursive code, look into naïve implementations of the <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ackermann_function#C" rel="noreferrer" title="Ackermann function">Ackermann function</a>.</p>
<p>Smart compilers can optimize the function, using the hint <code>inline</code> and &quot;unroll&quot; the function when constants are provided as arguments so that:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>f(12)
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
</code></pre>
<p>Without any function calls required!</p>
<p>Other compilers can reorganize the function:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>int f(int x)
{
    return (x &lt; 2)? 1: f(x - 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>And implement something called tail-recursion. This in effect replaces the last function call to a simple goto and lets that function deal with the return. The benefit is less stack thrashing, faster and smaller code.</p>
<p>In assembly language, these kinds of optimizing opportunities are really easy to spot and can be implemented by something called a &quot;keyhole optimizer&quot;, which basically looks for small patterns and replaces them with something faster and/or smaller.</p>

<p>C borrowed from languages contemporary at the time, the concept of a universal I/O which could be consistently applied to any device, whether console, punch card, tape, disc or printer, but in true C form, it allowed the developer to create very terse but powerful statements.</p>
<p>In the above snippet, it will take command line input, parse two integers separated by spaces, tabs or commas and output them. It takes advantage of a newer <code>scanf</code> specifier <code>%*[\t ,]</code> which will: <code>[\t ,]</code> pull out all tabs, spaces and commas, and: <code>*</code> ignore them.</p>
<p>I remember revising some C++ code where the developer was doing everything the &quot;pure&quot; C++ way with <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and an arsenal of methods like <code>find</code> and <code>substr</code>. It was at least a dozen lines and it still couldn't handle commas as delimiters. I replaced all that clunky code with a single <code>sscanf</code> line like above!</p>

<h3>Snippet 26 - iterate over matrices</h3>
<p>This is something I just recently discovered. Usually you iterate over a given vector in for loops. But instead of vectors, you can also use matrices (<code>rand(10)</code> produces a 10x10 matrix with uniformly distributed numbers between 0 and 1).</p>
<pre><code>for k=rand(10);disp(k);end
</code></pre>
<p>This then displays one column vector of the random matrix per iteration.</p>
<h3>Snippet 25 - easy plotting</h3>
<p>We know plotting is easy in matlab, but there is a super easy function <code>ezplot</code> (<code>E-Z</code> get it? It took quite a while until I finally got it, as I spelled <code>Z</code> always as <code>sed</code> instead of <code>c</code>, whatever...) Everyone likes elliptic curves:</p>
<pre><code>ezplot('y^2-x^3+9*x-10.3')
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/aj3x1.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/aj3x1.png" alt="elliptic curve" /></a></p>
<h3>Snippet 24 - integration</h3>
<p>The old fashioned word (but still in use in numerical computation) for integration is 'quadrature', can you guess what the result of the following one is?</p>
<pre><code>quad(@(x)4./(1+x.^2),0,1)
</code></pre>
<h3>Snippet 23 - images</h3>
<p>Of course Matlab is also very popular among scientists who have to work with images (e.g. medical image analysis), so here is a very handy function. First argument is the image, second the angle and the third optional argument here tells the function to crop it to original size.</p>
<pre><code>imrotate(rand(99),9,'c')
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/IkVJ9.png" alt="here" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 22 - music</h3>
<pre><code>load handel;sound(y,Fs)
</code></pre>
<p>It will sound about like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/wIIH5Bva738&amp;start=9&amp;end=19&amp;autoplay=1" rel="noreferrer">this (youtube link)</a></p>
<h3>Snippet 21 - differentiate &amp; integrate</h3>
<pre><code>polyint(polyder(p),c)
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily differentiate and integrate polynomials by using those two functions. When integrating, you can pass a second argument that will be the constant.</p>
<h3>Snippet 20 - back to polynomials</h3>
<pre><code>p=poly(r);cp=poly(A)
</code></pre>
<p>Want the polynomial with the roots in <code>r</code>? Easy: <code>p=poly(r)</code>. Want the characteristic polynomial of a matrix <code>A</code>? Easy: <code>cp=poly(A)</code>. So <code>roots(p)</code> is exactly <code>r</code> (or a permutation of <code>r</code>).</p>
<h3>Snippet 19 - another magic trick</h3>
<pre><code>fminsearch(fun,x0);
</code></pre>
<p>There are people who absolutely love this function. This basically just searches a minimum of <code>fun</code> with an initial value <code>x0</code> (can be a vector) without any conditions on <code>fun</code>. This is great for fitting small models where you cannot (or you are too lazy) to differentiate the error/penalty/objective function. It uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method" rel="noreferrer">Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm</a> which is pretty fast for functions where you cannot make any assumptions.</p>
<h3>Snippet 18 - intro to polynomials</h3>
<pre><code>p=polyfit(x,y,deg)
</code></pre>
<p>Matlab has a nice solution for coping with polynomials. With <code>polyfit</code> you get a least squares polynomial of degree <code>deg</code> that approximates the points in <code>x,y</code>. You get a vector <code>p</code> that stores the coefficients of the polynomials, because that is the only thing what you need for representing a polynomial. If you go back to snippet 15, you can do the same thing by writing <code>c = polyfit(x,y,2)</code>.  So e.g. <code>[1,-2,3]</code> represents the polynomial <code>x^2 - 2*x+3</code>.
Of course there are also functions for fitting other elementary, or arbitrary functions.</p>
<h3>Snippet 17 - angles and discontinuities</h3>
<pre><code>unwrap(angle(c))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to get the argument of a 'continuous' vector of complex numbers you often get back values that seem to have a discontinuity. E.g. <code>angle([-1-0.2i,-1-0.1i,-1,-1+0.1i,-1+0.2i])</code> will get you <code>[-2.94,-3.04,3.14,3.04,2.94]</code> since <code>angle</code> only returns angles between <code>-pi</code> and <code>pi</code>. The function <code>unwrap</code> will take care of this! If you get a discontinuity like this, it will just add a multiple of <code>2*pi</code> in order to remove those: '[-2.94,-3.04,-3.14,-3.24,-3.34]' This even works for 2d-matrices! If you just plot the argument of complex numbers with a negative real part you get the first graphics you'll get the first image, with unwrap you get the second one:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/avwYe.png" alt="without unwrap" /> <img src="https://i.sstatic.net/qgqwJ.png" alt="with unwrap" /></p>
<pre><code>[x,y] = meshgrid(-1:0.01:0,-0.5:0.01:0.5);
z = x+i*y;
imagesc(angle(z))
imagesc(unwrap(angle(z)))
</code></pre>
<h3>Snippet 16 - scalar product</h3>
<pre><code>[1;2;3]'*[4;5;6]
</code></pre>
<p>Of course there are built in methods (like <code>dot</code>), but with the matrix-transformation operator <code>'</code> it is as simple as that. If you do not know whether you have row or column vectors, you can just use <code>a(:)'*b(:)</code> where <code>a(:)</code> always returns a column vector.</p>
<h3>Snippet 15 - linear least squares, the ugly method with the magic wand</h3>
<pre><code>[x.^2,x,x.^0]\y
</code></pre>
<p><code>x</code> is the (column) vector with the values on the x-axis, <code>y</code> the noisy y-values. Type <code>c=[x.^2,x,x.^0]\y</code> and you get the coefficients of the 2nd degree polynomial. Of course you can use one of the billion builtin fit functions of matlab (how boring) why not use the magic wand?=)</p>
<pre><code>x = (-1:0.1:2)';
y = 3*x.^2-2*x+1+randn(size(x)); %add some gaussian (normal) noise
A = [x.^2,x,x.^0];
c = A\y              %output: c = ]3.0049; -2.3484; 1.1852]
plot(x,y,'x',x,A*c,'-')
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/fa8sV.png" alt="linreg" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 14 - graphs</h3>
<pre><code>gplot(graph,x)
</code></pre>
<p>That is how to plot a graph. <code>graph</code> should contain a square adjacency matrix and <code>x</code> should be a nx2 matrix that contains the coordinates of each node. Lets make a random graph: <code>graph = triu( rand(8)&gt;.7)</code> (make a Matrix that contains 0s and 1s, get only the upper triangle for an interesting graph). <code>x = rand(8,2)</code> then plot with some fancy styles <code>gplot(graph,x,'k-.d')</code></p>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/WE7ae.png" alt="graph" /> (I declare this as modern art.)</p>
<h3>Snippet 13 - meshgrid</h3>
<pre><code>meshgrid(a,b)
</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the most awesomest functions, simple but useful. If you want to plot a real valued function depending on two variables, you can just define a vector of values for the x-axis and one for the y-axis (a and b). Then with meshgrid, you can create two matrices of the size len(a) x len(b) where one has only the vector <code>a</code> as column, and the other has only the column has only the vectors <code>b</code> as rows. Usage example:<code>a = -3:0.2:3;[x,y]=meshgrid(a)</code> (if both vectors are the same, it is sufficient to just pass one.) Then you can just type <code>z=x.^2+-y.^2</code> and e.g. <code>mesh(x,y,z)</code>. This works for an arbitrary number of dimensions! So this is not only great for plotting, but also for getting all possible combinations of different vectors etc... (So, if you want to create a new code golf language, this should be in there, just make sure you use a shorter function name...)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/WQDAC.png" alt="mesh" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 12 - plotting</h3>
<pre><code>plot(x,x.^2)
</code></pre>
<p>Take a vector <code>x=-3:0.5:3</code> and and let <code>plot</code> do the rest. There are many more functions for plotting this is just a very basic one that you can use all the time. It would be already enough to write <code>plot(v)</code> and the data in <code>v</code> will be plotted against the array indices. How simple is that? If you want to style your plot, just add a string as a third argument: e.g. <code>'r:o'</code> will make a red, dotted line with circles around the data points. If you want multiple plots, just add more arguments, or use matrices instead of vectors. Foolproof. <img src="https://i.sstatic.net/v4JtZ.png" alt="plot" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 11 - function handles</h3>
<pre><code>f=@(x,y)x+y
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of a function handle that gets stored in <code>f</code>. Now you can call <code>f(1,2)</code> and get <code>3</code>. Function handles in matlab are very useful for math functions (e.g. plotting) and you can define them in one line. But one drawback is that you cannot have conditionals or piecewise (and therefore no recursion). If you want this, you have to use the <code>function</code> statement and declare a new function, and each of those has to be stored in a separate file... (WHYYYYYY????)</p>
<p>PS: You'll get another funny easter egg if you type <code>why</code> in the console: They made a huge function that produces random messages like:</p>
<pre><code>The tall system manager obeyed some engineer.
The programmer suggested it.
It's your karma.
A tall and good and not excessively rich and bald and very smart and good tall and tall and terrified and rich and not very terrified and smart and tall and young hamster insisted on it.
</code></pre>
<p>...which is very comforting if you are desperate enough to ask the console <code>why</code>...</p>
<h3>Snippet 10 - How does my matrix look?</h3>
<pre><code>spy(eye(9))
</code></pre>
<p>As you know by now <code>eye(9)</code> creates a 9x9 identity matrix. <code>spy</code> just creates a that shows the zero/nonzero entries of the matrix. But you can also use it for displaying any binary 2d data. If you call <code>spy</code> without argument you'll get a nice little easter egg=)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/1uLLs.png" alt="spy on identity" /> <img src="https://i.sstatic.net/yF1Wh.png" alt="spy easteregg" /></p>
<h3>Snippet 9</h3>
<pre><code>kron(a,b)

<p>The <code>kron</code> function evaluates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product" rel="noreferrer">Kronecker product</a> of two matrices. This is very useful for discretisized multidimensional linear operators. I also used it every now and then for code golfing. You want all possible products of the entries of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>? <code>kron(a,b)</code>, here you go.</p>
<h3>Snippet 8</h3>
<pre><code>5*a\b.*b
</code></pre>
<p>Ok here I mixed up 3 different operator. You can multiply any matrix by a scalar by just using <code>*</code>. (Then every entry of the matrix gets multiplied by that scalar). But <code>*</code> also performs matrix multiplications. If you prepend a dot you get the <code>.*</code> operator, this one multiplies two matrices of the same size but <em>entry wise</em>. (This can also be done with division operators like <code>/</code> and <code>\</code>.)</p>
<p>Next, the backslash operator can be used as left division (in contrast to <code>/</code> which performs right division as you are used to) but it is also the most powerful and characteristic operator of matlab: It performs a 'matrix division'. Lets say you have the system of linear equations <code>A*x=b</code> and you want to solve it for <code>x</code>, then you can just type <code>x=A\b</code>. And <code>\</code> (you can also use <code>/</code> but that is less common for matrices) first quickly analyzes the matrix, and uses the results to find the fastest algorithm to perform this inversion-multiplication! (See e.g. <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/18553210">here</a>)</p>
<p>But you can also use it for under- or over-defined systems (where the there exists no inverse or where the matrix isn't even square, e.g. for least squares method). This really is <strong>the magic wand</strong> of matlab.</p>
<h3>Snippet 7</h3>
<pre><code>[a,b;c]
</code></pre>
<p>Ok that does not look like much, but it is a very convenient tool: Matrix concatenation. A comma between two expressions means that they get concatenated horizontally (that means they have to have the same height) and a semicolon means that the previous 'line' will be above the next 'line' (by line I mean everything between two semicolons. Just a simple example:  <code>a = [1,2;3,4]; b = [5;6]; c =[7,8,9]; d=[a,b;c];</code> will result in the same <code>d</code> as <code>d=[1,2,5; 3,5,6; 7,8,9]</code>. (Get it?)</p>
<h3>Snipped 6</h3>
<pre><code>eye(7)
</code></pre>
<p>This function produces a full 7x7 identity matrix. It is that easy. There are other functions like <code>nan,inf,ones,zeros,rand,randi,randn</code> that work the very same way. (If you pass two arguments you can set the height/width of the resulting matrix.) As I will show later, you can easily create and (and in a very visual way) concatenate matrices (2d-arrays) which is sooo damn useful and easy if you have to numerically solve partial differential equations. (When you solve PDEs the general approach is discretisizig the derivative operators, basically you will get just a huge system of linear equations that needs to be solved. These matrices normally are sparse (only very few non-zero elements) and have some kind of symmetry. That's why you can easily 'compose' the matrix you need.</p>
<h3>Snippet 5</h3>
<pre><code>a(a&gt;0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>I hope you are not getting tired by all the ways of accessing arrays. This shows an easy way to get all elements of an array that meet some conditions. In this case you get a vector of all elements of <code>a</code> that are greater than 0.5. The expression <code>a&gt;0.5</code> just returns a matrix of the same size as <code>a</code> with ones for each element that satisfies the condition and a <code>0</code> for each element that doesn't.</p>
<h3>Snippet 4</h3>
<pre><code>a(:)
</code></pre>
<p>This again just returns the contents of <code>a</code> as a column vector (nx1 matrix). This is nice if you do not know whether you stored your data as column or row vector, or if your data is two dimensional (e.g. for 2d finite differences methods).</p>
<h3>Snippet 3</h3>
<pre><code>1:9
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily make vectors (in this case 1xn matrices) with the semicolon operator. In this case you get the vector <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]</code>. This is also particularly nice for accessing slices of other vectors as e.g. <code>a(2:4)</code> accesses the second, third and fourth element of the vector <code>a</code>. You can also use it with a step size, like <code>0:0.5:10</code> or so.</p>
<h3>Snippet 2</h3>
<pre><code>i;
</code></pre>
<p>A semicolon suppresses output to console. You can see it as a good or a bad thing, but I like it for debugging stuff. Any line of calculation etc. will automatically print its result to the console, as long as you do not suppress the output by a semicolon.</p>
<h3>Snippet 1</h3>
<pre><code>i
</code></pre>
<p>Complex number are a basic number type. (Too bad many people use <code>i</code> as a counting variable in for loops in which case it gets overridden.)</p>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>For those who do not know, MatLab is a programming language (with nice IDE that is also called MatLab?) that is first of all intended for numerical calculations* and data manipulation. (There is an open source counterpart called &quot;Octave&quot;) As it is only** interpreted it is not very fast, but it's strength are that you can easily manipulate matrices and many algorithms are implemented in an optimized way such that they run pretty fast when applied on matrices. It also is a very easy language to learn, but I do not recommend it as a starter language as you will assume pretty bad 'programming' habits.</p>
<p>*As it is a interpreted language it can be very slow for expensive projects, but you have built-in parallelization methods, and you can also use multiple computers together to run a program. But if you really wanna get fast I think you still depend on C or Fortran or crazy stuff like that. But still many implemented algorithms (matrix multiplication, solving systems of linear equations etc) are heavily optimized and perform quite well. But if you program the same algorithms in Matlab itself, you're gonna have to wait=) (Something really unintuitive when you come from other languages is that if you vectorize your operations instead of using for loops, you can save much time in Matlab.)</p>
<p>**You can sort of compile your programs, but that mainly converts the source code to an unreadable file (for humans), that is not that much faster when executed.</p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>The only valid characters in NO! are <code>NOno!?</code>. This language was created 2 hours ago and I'm currently writing this with my 12th cup of coffee in my hand. This language is close to the antithesis of code golf as demonstrated by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/114877/66833">this</a> answer to the <code>Hello, World!</code> challenge.</p>

<div id="pu67" class="pu"><h1>ActionScript 3</h1>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>AS3 is a scripting language designed to be used in client games and applications. It's a fully object oriented language that features dynamic objects that can be changed at run time, just like JavaScript.</p>

<h2>1-length code</h2>

<pre><code>7
</code></pre>

<p>Each number in AS3 is treated as an object.</p>

<h2>2-length code</h2>

<pre><code>as
</code></pre>

<p>AS3 is a strongly typed language; this is how to perform casting.</p>

<h2>3-length code</h2>

<pre><code>int
</code></pre>

<p>This is one of the two number types that AS3 contains. The designers of the language preferred to make it simple and included just two types:</p>

<ul>
<li>64-bit <code>float</code> for long values and floating points.</li>
<li>32-bit <code>int</code> for integers, perhaps for performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5-length code</h2>

<pre><code>a:*=1
</code></pre>

<p>In AS3, functions may have optional values; in this code snippet, 1 is assigned to <code>a</code> if no other value been passed to the function. The value after the <code>:</code> represents the type of <code>a</code>; in this case it's <code>*</code>, which means it can have any value. The difference between <code>*</code> and <code>object</code> is that <code>*</code> can also have undefined type. This is how Adobe <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/LiveCycleMosaic/9.0/actionscript/specialTypes.html#*" rel="nofollow noreferrer">explains</a> it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you want to defer type checking to runtime, you can use an untyped property or expression to circumvent compile-time type checking in strict mode. Note, however, that runtime type checking of assignment statements occurs whether you use strict mode or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>9-length-ish code</h2>

<pre><code>trace("a",0)
</code></pre>

<p><code>trace</code> is the best logging mechanism ever! You don't need to care about the type you are passing to the <code>trace</code> not the number of the params, it will simply print it all back to you, separated with a space char.</p>

<p><b>Factoid:</b></p>
<p>In Brain-Flak a one is shorter than zero and multiplying by seven takes more characters than multiplying by eight.</p>
<p><em>Since Brain-Flak programs must have an even number of characters I have added some programs with extra spaces for the odd length snippets.  These are not well golfed intentionally but rather put there in an attempt to give you a little more for your kind upvotes.</em></p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It switches to the offstack.  As a single program this will always output nothing regardless of the inputs.</p>
<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>{ }
</code></pre>
<p>This is the <code>{}</code> nilad it pops top item on the stack and returns its value.  As a full program it just removes the last item input.</p>
<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>(())
</code></pre>
<p>This program pushes one to the top of the stack.  This is the shortest way to express 1 in Brain-Flak.</p>
<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>([ ])
</code></pre>
<p>This program pushes the stack height to the top of the stack.  At the start of a program it acts like <code>argc</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 6 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}{})
</code></pre>
<p>This program adds two numbers.</p>
<p>It pops the top two elements and pushes the sum.</p>
<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>
<p>This one requires a <code>-d</code> flag to run so +3 bytes</p>
<p>(This one also doesn't work on try it online)</p>
<pre><code>@ij 
</code></pre>
<p>This is the injection flag! (With a space after it because it needs to be length 7)</p>
<p>This halts the program takes a Brain-Flak program from STDIN and runs it as part of the code.  Its my favorite flag and (arguably) Brain-Flak's shortest self interpreter.  <code>@ij</code> flags can be nested</p>
<h3>Length 8 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}&lt;&gt;)&lt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet moves the top of the current stack to the other stack.  It is a useful component of many programs.  It starts by opening a push with <code>(</code> pops the first value with <code>{}</code>, moves to the other stack using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> and puts the popped value down using <code>)</code>.  When that is done it moves back to the original stack with a <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 9 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}[()]) 
</code></pre>
<p><em>(One space after the program makes it 9 characters)</em></p>
<p>This snippet decrements the top of the stack by one.  It works by popping the top of the stack with <code>{}</code> and adding it to the negative of <code>()</code> (-1) and then pushing the result back on the stack.</p>
<h3>Length 10 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>{({}&lt;&gt;)&lt;&gt;}
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet will move values from one stack to another until it encounters a zero.  In many programs where it is known that the stack does not contain a zero this is used as a cheap stack reverse.</p>
<h3>Length 12 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>({}&lt;({}())&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>We've finally gotten long enough snippets that we can show off the usefulness of the <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> monad. This program increments the number underneath the top of the stack, while leaving the TOS intact. This approach can be extended. For example, this will increment the number second from the top of the stack:</p>
<pre><code>({}&lt;({}&lt;({}())&gt;)&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>In general, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>'({}&lt;' * n + &lt;code&gt; + '&gt;)' * n
</code></pre>
<p>to run <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> on the number that's <em>n</em> from the top without affecting the rest of the stack.</p>

<div id="pu69" class="pu"><h1>tinylisp</h1>

<h2>Factoid:</h2>

<p><code>tinylisp</code> is a language made by @DLosc for an "interpret this language" challenge. Its intent is to demonstrate what a Lisp-like language can do using only very few builtins.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dloscutoff/Esolangs/blob/master/tinylisp/tinylisp.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is an interpreter.</p>

<h2>Snippet 1:</h2>

<pre><code>d
</code></pre>

<p>This single character is perhaps the most used builtin in tinylisp: the <code>def</code> builtin. It can be used to define variables and functions, and is basically required for every tinylisp program. Like any other lisp-like language, you define things like this:</p>

<pre><code>(d x 10) // Creates a new variable x, and sets it to 10
(d succ  // Successor function, will be properly covered later
  (q (
    (x)
    (s 1 (s 0 x)))))
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 2:</h2>

<pre><code>()
</code></pre>

<p>Everything in tinylisp (and basically most Lisp-like languages) are built off of parentheses. In tinylisp, these parentheses define an empty list - which is one of three data types in tinylisp:</p>

<ul>
<li>Symbols</li>
<li>Numbers (which will be covered in the next snippet)</li>
<li>Lists</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 3:</h2>

<pre><code>1.5
</code></pre>

<p>tinylisp has numbers, but surprisingly enough, this is not a number. Numbers (at least, numbers you can type down before compilation) in tinylisp only have the characters <code>0-9</code> in them, and anything else is a name, so these "numbers" aren't numbers in tinylisp:</p>

<pre><code>-13    (contains -)
.335   (contains .)
17,232 (contains ,)
</code></pre>

<p><em>There's currently no way to define floats in tinylisp, however I'm working on implementing a fraction "class" thing in tinylisp. - Qwerp-Derp</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 4:</h2>

<pre><code>disp
</code></pre>

<p>This is a four-character builtin in tinylisp, however most builtins are only one character (see snippet <code>1</code> for an example). This basically returns a value to STDOUT, with a trailing newline.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 5:</h2>

<pre><code>(v 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, finally, a full statement that actually evaluates to something!</p>

<p>This e<code>v</code>aluates the number <code>1</code>, and therefore returns <code>1</code>. That's simple enough - more complicated examples are to come.</p>

<h2>Snippet 6:</h2>

<pre><code>(q(1))
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet <code>q</code>uotes the list <code>(1)</code>, and therefore evaluates to <code>(1)</code>. I'm doing the best I can with 6 bytes...</p>

<p><code>q</code> basically takes anything, and then returns the same thing, unevaluated. So for a program like this:</p>

<pre><code>(q (s 1 2))
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of returning <code>3</code>, it returns <code>(s 1 2)</code> instead.</p>

<h2>Snippet 7:</h2>

<pre><code>(s 1 2)
</code></pre>

<p><code>s</code> is the subtraction builtin; more specifically, it subtracts two integers. The above returns <code>-1</code>. Incidentally, <code>s</code> is the only way to get negative numbers in tinylisp (compare snippet 3).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Snippet 8:</h2>

<pre><code>(q(()1))
</code></pre>

<p>This is the simplest example of a lambda in tinylisp, and is essential to both evaluating other things and creating functions. The structure of lambdas is like so:</p>

<pre><code>(q (  ;; Lambdas have to be quoted using "q", so not to get evaluated
  ()  ;; A list of arguments, in this example there are 0 args, so
      ;; this is an empty list
  1   ;; The "body" of the lambda: in this case, we're returning 1
      ;; for every input.
))
</code></pre>

<p>This statement is essentially similar to the Python lambda <code>lambda:1</code> (which is also 8 bytes long, coincidentally). It can be used like so:</p>

<pre><code>( (q(()1)) )  ;; evaluates to 1
</code></pre>

<p>This shows off two new instructions (There are in fact only two unique ones in the program). These are the repeat <code>V</code> and the print_grid <code>.X</code> functions.</p>
<p><code>V</code> takes an integer or iterable and repeats the code the length of that iterable or the number of times. It takes the whole stack and when it loops, the current stack is kept and fed as input. If an iterable is passed, it also pushes that iterable at the beginning.</p>
<p><code>.X</code> is a special function in that it will probably only be used in challenges requiring a strict output format. It takes a string (with optional newlines) and pads it so it is in a grid-like format. It also optionally takes up to 8 characters to pad with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0: upper (all characters have this as default)</p>
<p>1: topleft (corners if undefined have this)</p>
<p>2: left line</p>
<p>3: right line</p>
<p>4: lower line</p>
<p>5: topright corner</p>
<p>6: bottomright corner</p>
<p>7: bottomleft corner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If no characters are given, it defaults to surrounding the entire thing with spaces. The program can stop defining extra characters by ending with a <code>&quot;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>V           - repeat number of times:

<p>Infinite lists are effectively Python's generators. At the end of a Pyke program, all infinite lists on the stack are unwound as far as it will go in the time limit available (or none if done offline). Pyke has operators to filter and map nodes to infinite lists as well as combine them in various ways. Infinite lists are a relatively new feature and have been used in several short answers.</p>

<p>This program is the beginning in a chain of programs which output larger versions of themselves. </p>

<p>This program pushes <code>95</code>, copies (<code>&amp;</code>) it, then pushes <code>34</code>. <code>_</code> prints the stack's values, and <code>"</code> prints it again but as a string, resulting in:</p>

<pre><code>95 95 34

<p>Which in turn outputs:</p>

<pre><code>95 95 34
95 95 34

</code></pre>

<p>5 or so iterations later, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34
95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34 95 95 34

<p>This is in fact an adaption of my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/104293/60919">asterisk triangle</a> answer. Given an integer, for example <code>n = 5</code>, it prints a "d-triangle" of this size:</p>

<p>This is a concise example of both loops and char-code conversion in Pushy:</p>

<pre><code>:    \ Input times do (consuming input):
 H   \   Push 100 to the stack (character code for 'd')
  "  \   Print the whole stack, as a string.
</code></pre>

<p>As each iteration pushes a new <code>'d'</code>, this creates a triangle.</p>

<p>Notice there is no "end-loop" delimiter: this is normally signified with a <code>;</code>. However, the interpreter automatically assumes these to be at the end of the program if omitted.</p>

<p>Click on any snippet's header to try it in the <a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter</a>!</p>

<p>For reference, <strong>the text in bold tells you the important stuff.</strong></p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Cubix is a stack-based language, created by me, which runs like a 2D language such as Befunge. The main difference? <strong>The code is run on the outside of a cube.</strong></p>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=QA==&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 1</a></h3>

<pre><code>@
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty much the character most commonly used. Why? Because <strong>it immediately ends execution of the program.</strong> In fact, it's the only way to end the program.</p>

<p>This is useless as a program, though, because it gets turned into this cube:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;. . . .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>Where the IP (instruction pointer) is started at the arrow, and <code>.</code> is a no-op. This just loops around forever. Take a good look and you'll see why <em>every</em> possible 1-byte program never ends (or does anything at all).</p>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=Lk8=&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 2</a></h3>

<pre><code>.O
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we've gotten over the length-1 barrier, we can finally see some output! Here's the cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   .
&gt;O . . .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>where the IP starts at the arrow. <strong><code>O</code> takes the TOS (top-of-stack) and outputs it as a number.</strong> If the stack is empty (e.g. at the beginning of the program), this prints <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>When the IP gets over to the right edge of the above cube-net, it wraps back around to the left edge, onto the <code>O</code> again. Thus, this program prints <code>0</code> forever.</p>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=QE8v&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 3</a></h3>

<pre><code>@O/
</code></pre>

<p>Our first <s>cheerleader</s> program that terminates! This gets mapped to the following net:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;O / . .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>where the IP starts at the arrow. As we've seen before, the <code>O</code> prints the TOS, which is currently <code>0</code>, as a number. Next comes a new character: <code>/</code>. This is a mirror. There are five different mirrors: <code>/</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>_</code>, and <code>T</code>. <strong>Mirrors reflect the IP from one direction to another.</strong></p>

<p>When the IP hits this mirror, it is redirected to the north. This puts it on the top face, which is <code>@</code>. Thus, the program is terminated, and the output is <code>0</code>.</p>

<pre><code>@Io^
</code></pre>

<p>This expands into the following cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;I o ^ .
   .
</code></pre>

<p>A bunch of new characters here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first character is <code>I</code>, which <strong>inputs an integer from STDIN</strong>.</li>
<li>Next comes <code>o</code>. This is like <code>O</code>, but <strong>outputs a char-code</strong> instead of an integer.</li>
<li>After that, we see <code>^</code>. This is one of four arrows: <code>^</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>v</code>, and <code>&lt;</code>. <strong>Arrows point the IP in a specific direction.</strong> <code>^</code> points the IP north, where it hits the <code>@</code> and terminates.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>@i?o_
</code></pre>

<p>Finally a (somewhat) useful program. This expands into the following cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   @
&gt;i ? o _
   .
</code></pre>

<p>This is a <code>cat</code> program: it prints the entirety of the input, one char at a time.</p>

<p>The first character is <code>i</code>, which <strong>inputs a char-code from STDIN</strong>. If there's nothing in STDIN, it pushes <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>Next comes <code>?</code>. This is one of the most useful chars: <strong>it redirects the IP based on the sign of the TOS.</strong> If the TOS is negative, the IP turns left; if the TOS is positive, the IP turns right; if the TOS is zero, the IP continues in the same direction.</p>

<p>The combination of these chars does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the input is a null byte, the IP continues straight, outputting with <code>o</code> and wrapping back around to the <code>i</code>. (The <code>_</code> is a mirror which does nothing when the IP is traveling east-west.)</li>
<li>If the input is anything else, the IP turns right, wrapping around to the bottom and hitting the <code>_</code>. This turns it around; it goes back across the bottom and hits the <code>?</code> again, turning right. This time, though, it's sent through the <code>o</code> and back around to the <code>i</code>.</li>
<li>If there is no more input, the IP turns left, hits <code>@</code>, and ends the program.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://ethproductions.github.io/cubix/?code=OU8vOylv&amp;speed=4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 6</a></h3>

<pre><code>9O/;)o
</code></pre>

<p>Our first happy program! <code>;)</code> This expands into the following cube net:</p>

<pre><code>   9
&gt;O / ; )
   o
</code></pre>

<p>The first character is <code>O</code>, which prints the TOS (currently <code>0</code>). Then the IP hits a mirror <code>/</code> which redirects it over the top face onto the <code>9</code>. <strong>Digits push themselves to the stack.</strong> Note that they do not concatenate; <code>12</code> pushes a <code>1</code> and a <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>So now the TOS is <code>9</code>. The IP comes down on the other side of the cube and hits the <code>)</code>, which <strong>increments the TOS by 1.</strong> Now the TOS is 10, which tells the <code>o</code> on the bottom face to output a newline.</p>

<p>The IP comes up and hits the mirror again, turning to the east. The next character it hits is the <code>;</code>, which <strong>pops the TOS (removes it).</strong> The stack is now back to its natural state with infinite <code>0</code>s. </p>

<p>Next is the <code>)</code>, which increments the TOS to 1. Now the IP is back at the start of the program, except the TOS is now <code>1</code> instead of <code>0</code>. Can you figure out what this program does?</p>

<div id="pu74" class="pu"><h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0R1Jgqp8Gg4cVJCZkRkdEthZDQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">QBIC</a></h2>

<p>I'm trying to teach QuickBasic to do codegolf (and myself in the process), so I'm creating the language Quick Basic Interpreter for Codegolf, or QBIC for short.</p>

<p><strong>0 byte factoid</strong></p>

<p>Most of QBIC's strength lies in just making a shorthand for QBasic's expansive syntax, but I've also incorporated several features of my own. When generating the trans-compiled BAS file, a standard header is imported that implements some of these features. For instance, the numbers 1 through 10 get initialised as variables <code>q</code> through <code>z</code>. This occasionally saves me some bytes when initialising a FOR loop, and shaves a byte off of using <code>10</code>.</p>

<p><strong>1 byte</strong></p>

<pre><code>}
</code></pre>

<p>The above statement will do ... exactly nothing. When found in the QBIC code, it wil automatically add END IF's, NEXTs and LOOPs for every opened IF/FOR/DO construct it finds (in the correct order, naturally). Note that <code>]</code> does the same for one language construct, where <code>}</code> closes all opened constructs.</p>

<p>However, since we've not yet opened any of those constructs, this does nothing and results in an 'empty' Qbasic BAS file. Also, at the end of compiling QBIC, the compiler will run this statement automatically.</p>

<p><strong>2 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>?z
</code></pre>

<p>This will write 10 on the screen. In QBIC, the letters of the lower-case alphabet are references to numerical variables. This is retained from QBasic, where <code>PRINT a</code> would give me a <code>0</code> on the screen (even without ever defining <code>a</code>). In addition, QBIC initialises q-z to be 1 through 10 by default. The <code>?</code> is obviously shorthand for the <code>PRINT</code> statement and writes to screen.</p>

<p><strong>3 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>_Xb
</code></pre>

<p><code>_X</code> can be used to terminate a program, and when used with a suffix, it will print something on exit. Suffixes can be A-Z (which refers to string variables A$ - Z$) or lowercase a-z (for the numerical vars of this name). The example snippet ends the program, and prints variable <code>b</code> to screen before it turns off the lights.</p>

<p><strong>4 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>?_r|
</code></pre>

<p><code>_r</code> is a random number generator. By itself, it will generate a random number between 0 and 10 and, in this case, print it. We can also add one or two parameters for a different lower and upper bound; If only one is specified, that's our new upper bound.<br>
<code>_r20|</code> will generate a number between 0 and 20.<br>
<code>_r5,18|</code> will generate a number between 5 and 18. 
The statement <code>_R</code> is equivalent to <code>_r</code> with one exception: <code>_R</code> assigns to a variable, <code>_r</code> does not:</p>

<pre><code>?_r|    PRINT getNextRandomNumber(0, 10)
_R|?a   a = getNextRandomNumber(0, 10) : PRINT a
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>:_Ra|
</code></pre>

<p>The above snippet introduces the <code>:</code>, which reads the first unread command line parameter and assigns it to the first available numeric var. The resulting QBasic code for this snippet is:</p>

<pre><code>a = assignCMDToNum!
b = getRandomNumber(0, a)
</code></pre>

<p>There's also <code>;</code>, which does the same for string variables.</p>

<p><strong>6 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>?!z$+A
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we see a cast in action. QBasic is kinda picky when it comes to data types. Adding a string to an integer will result in errors. To work around this, I've added a casting function. The above snippet will print <code>10</code> (<code>z</code> is auto-initialised to <code>10</code>) and append whatever is in the variable <code>A$</code>. For instance, a full program could be</p>

<pre><code>#test`?!z$+A
</code></pre>

<p>and the result then is <code>10test</code>.</p>

<p>Casting is done using the <code>!</code> symbol. It then casts everything between the <code>!</code> and the delimiter. Usually <code>|</code> is the delimiter for variable-length arguments, but CAST uses either a <code>$</code> to perform the cast from number to string, or another <code>!</code> to cast a string to number.</p>

<p><strong>7 bytes</strong></p>

<pre><code>Z=_f_tA
</code></pre>

<p>Lot going on here. Let's work on the assumption that <code>A$</code> already holds a value, say "  Hello  " (significant spaces). This snippet then sets <code>Z$</code> to the reversed (<code>_f</code>), trimmed (<code>_t</code>) version of <code>A$</code>, <code>olleH</code> and prints it to the screen.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The behaviour between <code>_f</code> and <code>_F</code> is different: <code>_F</code> declares a variable and assigns its output to it, <code>_f</code> only gives the output and assigning is done by other parts of the script. The same goes for <code>_r</code> in my 5-byte snippet. This is called <strong>ULX</strong>, or Upper-Lowercase Extension. Whether or not output gets auto-assigned is one of the behavioural changes ULX can bring, but there are other examples. <code>_D</code>, for intance, yields the system date, <code>_d</code> yelds system time. Both don't auto-assign.</p></li>
<li><p><code>_t</code> removes the whitespace on both sides of its argument. <code>_u</code> does a left-trim, <code>_v</code> does right-trim. All three support ULX, and for all three this switches between auto-assign (uppercase) or output only (lowercase).</p></li>
<li><p>Both <code>_f</code> and <code>_t</code> should be delimited with <code>|</code> to signify the end of the parameter list. However, since EOF is reached, the correct number of <code>|</code>'s get added to close all opened parameter lists. If this statement would have been followed by the closing commands for language constructs (<code>]</code>or <code>}</code>, see byte 1) those same <code>|</code>'s would get added.</p></li>
<li><p>QBIC allows for the result of one function to be the input for the next: <code>_f</code> takes as input the result of <code>_t</code></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if we would run this program, it would actually print <code>olleH</code>, despite we never use a <code>?</code> or <code>_X*</code> statement. This is because QBIC implicitly prints the contents of Z$ on exit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Summarizing, the above 7-byte snippet would roughly compile into this QBasic block:</p>

<pre><code>FUNCTION revstring$(in$)
  ... function definition imported through QBIC.H
END FUNCTION 

... we set A$ to be "  Hello  "

Z$ = revstring$(LTRIM$(RTRIM$(A$)))

PRINT Z$
</code></pre>

<p><strong>8 bytes</strong></p>

<p>Let's look at literals. There are 2 types in QBIC: String literals (Verbal and Silent) and Code Literals. They are started with <code>@</code>, <code>#</code> and <code>'</code> respectively, are terminated with ```. Using a <code>&amp;boxul;</code> respresents a line-break.</p>

<pre><code>?@check`  --&gt; Verbal string literal: Defines A$ in the header, assign the value "check" 
              to it, and insert A$ in the body of the resulting QBasic at this moment. 
#10`?A+A  --&gt; Silent literal: Defines the literal A$ as "10", but doesn't insert `A$` 
              in the QBasic output at this time. This sample then prints "1010"; `+`in 
              this context is string concatenation.
'SQR(9)`  --&gt; Code literal: from the `'`(which would be seen as a comment by QBasic) to
              the ``` is not stored as a variable, but passed unaltered to the resulting 
              QBasic. This particular statement calculates the root of 9.

<div id="pu77" class="pu"><h1>Racket</h1>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong> : A programmable programming language: Racket is a full-spectrum programming language. It goes beyond Lisp and Scheme with dialects that support objects, types, laziness, and more. (<a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://racket-lang.org/</a>) </p>

<p>(I am surprised no one has added Racket till now).</p>

<p>Functions or procedures need to be in parentheses. First term in parentheses is procedure name, rest are its arguments. If an argument is a procedure, it has to be in its own brackets. Values (non-procedures) are written without brackets. </p>

<p>Main syntax difference between Java and Racket is f(a, b) vs (f a b), x+y+z vs (+ x y z), x == y vs (eq? x y) and x=2 vs (define x 2), or if already defined, (set! x 2). There is no need to declare types like public static void or int char string etc. </p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>i
</code></pre>

<p>Prints value of i.</p>

<p>Also: + - / * are functions: </p>

<pre><code>(+ 1 2 3 4)  
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 10 (all numbers are added together)</p>

<pre><code>(* 1 2 3 4)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 24 (product of all numbers)</p>

<pre><code>(/ 20 5 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 2 (20 is divided by 5 as well as 2)</p>

<pre><code>(- 10 5 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 3 (5 and 2 are subtracted from 10)</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>pi
</code></pre>

<p>Prints value of pi: </p>

<pre><code>3.141592653589793
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<pre><code>let 
</code></pre>

<p>For local binding as in: </p>

<pre><code>(let ( (x 5)   (y 10) )
  (println  (* x y))
)
; x and y are not visible here; 
</code></pre>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>map
</code></pre>

<p>Subjects each item of a list to the sent function, e.g. to double every item of the list:</p>

<pre><code>(map    (lambda(x) (* 2 x))    (list 1 2 3) )
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>'(2 4 6)
</code></pre>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>for 
</code></pre>

<p>Standard for loop as well as its extensions: </p>

<pre><code>for* for/list for/sum for/product for/first for/last for/and for/or 
</code></pre>

<p>There are more extensions <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html</a> !</p>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<p>Conditionals: </p>

<pre><code>cond 
</code></pre>

<p>For example (from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/racket-cheat/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.racket-lang.org/racket-cheat/index.html</a>): </p>

<pre><code>(cond 
  [(even? x) 0] 
  [(odd? x) 1] 
  [else "impossible!"]) 
</code></pre>

<p>Also</p>

<pre><code>list
</code></pre>

<p>Being derived from Lisp &amp; Scheme, list is very important data structure here:</p>

<pre><code>(list 1 "a" #\a (list 1 2 3)) 
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<pre><code>match 
</code></pre>

<p>Match is like case-switch: </p>

<pre><code>(match x
  [3 (displayln "x is 3")]
  [4 (displayln "x is 4")]
  [5 (displayln "x is 5")]
  [default (displayln "none of the above")])
</code></pre>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>apply 
</code></pre>

<p>This opens a list and provides all elements to the function, for example: </p>

<pre><code>(apply + (list 1 2 3 4 5))
</code></pre>

<p>becomes: </p>

<pre><code>(+ 1 2 3 4 5) ; =&gt; 15
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 6</h2>

<p>Define: a very basic function- to assign value to a variable: </p>

<pre><code>(define s "A string")
(define n 10)
</code></pre>

<p>Also:<br>
printf - the print function: </p>

<pre><code>(printf "~a ; ~a ~n" s n)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: </p>

<pre><code>A string ; 10 
</code></pre>

<p>Also: Filter - a function that filters a list for items which give true value to the specified function (sent as an argument):  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; (filter string? (list "a" "b" 6))
'("a" "b")
&gt; (filter positive? (list 1 -2 6 7 0))
'(1 6 7)
</code></pre>

<p>The test function can be specified: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; (filter 
    (lambda(x) (&gt; x 2))    ; function to test each element
    '(1 2 3 4 5))          ; full input list to be filtered
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>'(3 4 5)                   ; output list of elements greater than 2
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 7</h2>

<p>println : one of most commonly used function. Prints out the sent string with a newline character at end: </p>

<pre><code>(println "String to be printed")
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: examples are from various sources on the net).</p>

<div id="pu78" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://github.com/LogicodeLang/Logicode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Logicode</a></h1>
<h2>Factoid:</h2>
<p>Logicode has a very limited amount of built-ins (7 built-ins, of which 6 are single-char), which makes it pretty difficult to program anything meaningful in.</p>
<p>Also, it's built on logic gates, as the name suggests, and that's it - which makes it doubly hard to code stuff in.</p>
<p>You can try it online <a href="http://logicode.tryitonline.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Length 1 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>+
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>+</code> is not addition, as that can be achieved easily. It's concatenation between two &quot;numbers&quot; (which are binary): So, something like <code>11+1</code> is not <code>100</code>, as with regular binary addition, but <code>111</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 2 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>-&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>-&gt;</code> is used in two main things: circuits (which are Logicode's version of functions) and conditionals (<code>if</code> statements). It is used to separate the executed code from the arguments (in the case of circuits) or the condition (in the case of conditionals).</p>
<h2>Length 3 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>out
</code></pre>
<p>This is a declarer, kinda like <code>var</code> in Javascript to declare a new variable. Logicode has a declarer for anything: <code>out</code> for output, <code>var</code> for variables, <code>circ</code> for circuits (which are basically functions in Logicode), <code>cond</code> for conditionals.</p>
<h2>Length 4 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>!100
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>!</code> is a logical NOT, which is operated on every digit of the binary string that follows. In this case, the snippet evaluates to <code>011</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 5 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>1&amp;1&amp;1
</code></pre>
<p>In Logicode, you're allowed to stack multiple two-arg (dyadic) operators together, as seen here. The <code>&amp;</code> is a logical AND, and the snippet evaluates to <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>Length 6 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>@11011
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, ASCII support! Because the default &quot;type&quot; of Logicode is binary strings, the <code>@</code> converts binary to ASCII codes (mod 256). In this case, the character generated is <code>ESC</code> (ASCII character code 27).</p>
<h2>Length 7 Snippet:</h2>
<pre><code>1000&lt;&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes the tail of <code>1000</code> three times. A tail is essentially every character but the first, so repeating this three times gives us:</p>
<pre><code>1000 -&gt; 000 -&gt; 00 -&gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>So this evaluates to 0.</p>

<div id="pu81" class="pu"><h1>///</h1>

<p>/// is a minimalist Turing-complete esoteric programming language. The only operation is repeated string substitution, using the syntax <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=XG4&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 2</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>\n
</code></pre>

<p>This won't print a newline. A <code>\</code> in this language means that it'll print the next character, so it'll print a <code>n</code>. <code>\</code>s are used mostly for printing <code>/</code>s, like this: <a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=XC8&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><code>\/</code></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=Ly8v&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 3</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>///

<p>This is an infinite loop that does nothing, and is also the language name. It keeps replacing nothing with nothing.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy8v&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 4</strong></a> ★</p>

<pre><code>/☃//
</code></pre>

<p>This attempts to replace a snowman with nothing/remove every snowman. Since the entire source code, except the <code>/☃//</code> part, doesn't contain a snowman, it doesn't do anything.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Length 4</strong> ★</p>

<pre><code>/ //

<p>Unary addition! Put both numbers on the right side of the snippet. (since /// can't take input) Like this: <a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=LyAvLzAwMDAwIDAwMA&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><code>/ //00000 000</code></a></p>

<pre><code>☃/☃//
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet is important for showing one thing: string substitution doesn't work on anything that comes before the <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>.</p>

<p>If you take a look at snippet length 4, it removes every snowman. But that won't work if there are snowmen before the <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>, so he stays there and get printed.</p>

<p>However, this snippet would remove the snowman, because the snowman comes after the <code>/pattern/replacement/</code> part: <a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy8v4piD&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><code>/☃//☃</code></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Length 5</strong> ★</p>

<pre><code>/\///
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet completely breaks the language. It works by removing every <code>/</code>.</p>

<pre><code>/
/☃/
(newline)
</code></pre>

<p>Remember the second snippet? Instead of writing <code>\n</code>, you use a literal new line.</p>

<p>Because Markdown apparently doesn't like empty lines of code, you have to remove the <code>(newline)</code> part when trying this in <a href="http://tryitonline.net" rel="noreferrer">Try it online!</a> or any other /// interpreter.</p>

<p>You probably guessed it by now, but I'll explain it anyways. The <code>/\n/☃/</code> part replaces every newline with a snowman. Since there's a trailing new line in the snippet, it gets replaced by a snowman and printed.</p>

<p>This is probably kinda boring, but don't worry, I have something more interesting planned for the seventh snippet :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy_imIM4L-KYgw&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 7</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>/☃/☃8/☃
</code></pre>

<p>This is an infinite loop. More interesting than the sixth snippet IMO.</p>

<p>When /// finds a <code>/pattern/replacement/</code>, it will keep replacing <code>pattern</code> with <code>replacement</code> until there are no more <code>pattern</code>s to be replaced. Therefore, if <code>replacement</code> contains <code>pattern</code>, it will always end up on an infinite loop.</p>

<p>There will always be a snowman to get replaced with a snowman and a badly drawn snowman:</p>

<pre><code>☃

☃88
(☃)88
☃888
...

<p><strong>Alternative Length 7</strong> ★</p>

<pre><code>/0 0/ /

<p>Unary subtraction! Put the numbers in this order: <code>largest smallest</code>, like this: <a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=LzAgMC8gLzAwMDAwMDAgMDAwMDA&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><code>/0 0/ /0000000 00000</code></a></p>

<pre><code>/☃/\//\☃
</code></pre>

<p>Yay, 8 upvotes! An eight is the number that looks the most like a snowman.</p>

<p>The <code>/☃/\//</code> part replaces every snowman with a <code>/</code>. So you will probably think that if I place a snowman in the code, it'll print a <code>/</code>. Wrong.</p>

<p>Since <code>/</code>s are used for repeated string substitution, you'll have to put a <code>\</code> before the <code>/</code> (in this case, the <code>☃</code>) if you wanna print it.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious, but I forgot it once and spent some minutes trying to find the bug in my code.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy9cXFxcL-KYgw&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 9</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>/☃/\\\\/☃
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>/☃/\\\\/</code> part replaces every snowman with two <code>\</code> (Since <code>\\</code> is only one <code>\</code>, <code>\\\\</code> is actually <code>\\</code>).</p>

<p>There's only one snowman after that, so it gets replaced by the two <code>\</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the two <code>\</code> turn into only one <code>\</code> and that gets printed.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy84L-KYgy84L0I&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 10</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>/☃/8/☃/8/B

<p>If you pay attention, the second replacement is incomplete. The first replacement replaces a snowman with an eight.</p>

<p>The second replacement doesn't do anything, since it's incomplete. Syntax errors don't exist in ///, so nothing happens. If you don't believe me, turn on debug on TIO.</p>

<p><a href="http://slashes.tryitonline.net/#code=L-KYgy84Ly84L-KYgy_imIM&amp;input=" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Length 11</strong></a></p>

<pre><code>/☃/8//8/☃/☃

<p>I just realized today is 11/11, I'm adding snippet length 11 and this post has 11 upvotes...</p>

<p>I don't think there is anything important left to showcase about this language, /// is very simple. But I'll still try to add more snippets.</p>

<p>This is probably obvious, but replacements can modify other replacements.</p>

<p>The first replacement replaces every snowman with an eight:</p>

<pre><code>/8/☃/☃
/8/(☃)/(☃)
/8/8/8
</code></pre>

<p>This is an infinite loop (<code>/8/8/</code>), since there will always be an eight to be replaced.</p>

<pre><code>?&lt;!@&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the AND gate, from one of the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/83209/59806">16 Logic Gates answer by Martin Ender♦</a>. In his answer, the explanation was left for readers as practise. Well, maybe it's time for the solution:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/3TpOP.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/3TpOP.png" alt="and1"></a></p>

<p>First <code>?</code> reads the first input.  </p>

<p>If it is <code>0</code>, then the IP got reflected to NE direction at <code>&lt;</code> and directly wraps "to the left" (as it is <code>&lt;=0</code>) and got printed at <code>!</code>.  Whatever it reads at <code>?</code>, it wraps and stops at <code>@</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/uxZRs.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/uxZRs.png" alt="and2"></a></p>

<p>If it is <code>1</code>, the IP takes the right branch for the "conditional" and hit the "inclined mirror" side of <code>&lt;</code> and got reflected back and hit the "hub" side of <code>&lt;</code> which sends it to W direction to read another input. It then wraps and hit the "horizontal mirror" side of <code>&lt;</code> and gets itself to an implicit-if at the corner. <strong>6</strong> instructions made within this blue path.</p>

<p><em>The different usages of <code>&lt;</code> are all demostrated in this example</em>.</p>

<p>If the second input is <code>0</code>, then the IP goes along the red path above, which prints a <code>0</code> and reads the "third" input and stops.</p>

<p>If it is a <code>1</code> instead, yay we finally got 2 <code>1</code>s for the AND gate! The IP goes along the green path and prints out the <code>1</code> and terminates!</p>

<p>These 2 are simplified (thus not a very good version) of a <code>cat</code> program. For a real working one, please see <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62306">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>,;~
</code></pre>

<p>This reads and prints and also outputs a lot of trailing mysterious symbols.  What's happening?</p>

<p><code>,</code> reads a byte and <code>;</code> prints it no matter what <code>,</code> gets (If there is no input, <code>,</code> will return a <code>-1</code> and <code>;</code> will print it modulo 256 which is <code>255</code>).</p>

<p>Here is a trick which is useful in creating Hexagons: Using <code>~</code> (negation) to control the direction the IP goes before it reaches an <code>if</code> (no matter it is an implicit one or an explicit one like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> and some other conditionals).</p>

<p>If you find this hard to understand, then it's worth mentioning that this is <em>not</em> a linear loop.  As an exercise imagine the above are put into a 2-hexagon and you'll see why we need <code>~</code> to do make a loop with the implicit if :P The code basically runs in the same manner as in the length 2 snippet below!</p>

<p>Thus, when there is a byte, the memory will be positive and <code>~</code> makes it negative so it goes back to the top to read another byte.  Yet it won't stop...</p>

<p>So let's see the length 4 version of the <code>cat</code>.</p>

<p>When you <a href="http://hexagony.tryitonline.net/#code=PCxAOw&amp;input=SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try</a> this, it looks good.  Finally we have one program which stops!</p>

<p>It starts on the top left with an initial value of <code>0</code>. A trick here which is (again) quite common - deflect the initial IP with <code>&lt;</code>.  This is particularly useful when the main loop should end when the calculated value is <code>&lt;=0</code>.</p>

<p>Here it comes to the blue path. <code>;</code> prints the null byte (as it is initially <code>0</code>) and <code>,</code> reads a byte. An implicit-if decides if it should go to the green one (doing nothing and wraps back to the main blue loop for printing this byte) or it should go to the red terminal <code>@</code>.  </p>

<p>In some code golf challenges, it is acceptable to have null bytes printed before the desired output.  However this is not the case for the simple cat challenge attached above :P  Also, this does not handle null bytes <code>\0</code> well.  If you are curious how to do the <code>cat</code> with 6 bytes which handles <code>\0</code> and prints nothing else and stops, <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62306">check it out</a>! (The 6 bytes solution is shown after the 7 bytes)</p>

<p><em>This won't end.</em> Print all non-negative integers separated by <code>-</code>. </p>

<pre><code>!(
</code></pre>

<p>Not really. Indeed this is printing the unintialized edge as number (<code>0</code>), then decrement it and print again without a separator (<code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>, ...)</p>

<p>This is an illustration of both the Implicit Loop (wrapping) and Implicit If.</p>

<p>The IP starts at <code>!</code>, goes to the right to <code>(</code> and wraps to... not (directly to) <code>!</code> but somewhere else first. Because the code is used to fill in the smallest possible hexagon that can hold it:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/7aK8B.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/7aK8B.png" alt="showcase_2"></a></p>

<p>(Blue) For the existing code, after IP runs <code>(</code> (decrements) and the memory edge becomes <code>-1</code>, it wraps to the middle row and goes all its way to the corner.</p>

<p>And, as its value is <code>&lt;=0</code>, it goes to the left, which is the top row and we hit <code>!</code> again which prints <code>-1</code> and so on...</p>

<p>(Red) And if you change the source code to <code>!)</code>, it won't print <code>01234...</code>.  Because when it hits the corner, the memory edge is <code>&gt;0</code> and it turns to the right option (Pun not intended) which is the lower edge, and the lower edge wraps back to the middle - however all the ops are no-ops so the IP can never escape from the loop.</p>

<h3><a href="http://hexagony.tryitonline.net/#code=Og&amp;input=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Length 1 Snippet</a></h3>

<pre><code>:
</code></pre>

<p>If you try it, it ends soon and nothing will happen. Well 1 byte snippet in Hexagony can't do much.</p>

<p><code>:</code> is the division in Hexagony and the result is rounded towards <code>-infty</code>.  </p>

<p>Why introduce this? Lemme introduce the Memory Model of this one.  <em>Without loss of generality</em> (it sounds good using Maths phrases), this is the initial Memory Pointer:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/TurD2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/TurD2.png" alt="memory_model"></a></p>

<p>Like Instruction Pointers which has an Op which it's currently on (a position) and a direction, the MP also has an edge (which holds a value) and a direction.</p>

<p>The edge on its left is its Left Neighbor (L) and that on right is the Right Neighbor (R).</p>

<p>Like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>%</code> (Modulo), <code>:</code> is also calculating <code>L (operation) R</code>.</p>

<p>One "interesting" thing about <code>:</code> and <code>%</code> is that when the Right Neighbor is <code>0</code> (the default value of an uninitialized edge), it silently errors out and hence terminating the program.  This behaviour sometimes saves bytes when the termination <code>@</code> is not used to stop the program.</p>

<p>I have read the answer here which is nice :P I also found some interesting snippets on this site thus I would like to try to get a chance to post them. <em>I love Hexagons!</em></p>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>Hexagony, as its name suggests, gives programmers a painful experience (agony) playing with Hexagons, with its Instruction Pointers (IP) and Memory Pointers (MP).  Great thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Timwi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Timwi</a> who created <a href="https://github.com/Timwi/EsotericIDE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Esoteric IDE</a> for debugging Esoteric Languages and <a href="https://github.com/Timwi/HexagonyColorer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hexagony Colorer</a> which helps explaining the coupled IP paths.</p>

<p>When an IP goes out of the Hexagon, it wraps (Yup, implicitly looping) as if the Hexagon is used for tiling the ground. (Not exactly the case, because if you really wanna connect all wrapping paths, you would end up their edge overlapped like the graph on the right)
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/Rfmh8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/Rfmh8.png" alt="Wrapping"></a>
<code>c1234</code> wraps to <code>567890</code> wraps back to <code>c1234</code>...
<code>abcd</code> wraps to <code>efgh</code> and goes on... and we hit a corner.</p>

<p>For corner cases, there will be an Implicit-If, with <code>&lt;=0</code> is left and <code>&gt;0</code> is right. Say you (the instruction pointer when you are programming) go all the way <code>efgh.3.</code> to the corner. You are facing East.  You would either wrap to the top which is on your <em>left</em> and the bottom which is on your <em>right</em>.  If the MP is pointing to a memory edge which is <code>&lt;=0</code> you goes to the top, otherwise you goes to the bottom.</p>

<p>True beauty lies in making use of the implicit features and fitting different parts of the algorithm into Great Hexagonal Unity, with the use of mirrors (always like playing with scientific puzzle solving game).</p>

<div id="pu83" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/SuperJedi224/Golfical" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Golfical</a></h1>

<p>Golfical is a shiny, brand-new graphical programming language I made over the past few days, and published earlier today.</p>

<p>It uses a stack, a tape, and a register as memory. But primarily the tape.</p>

<p>The included encoder utility can be used to compress programs into a raw binary form, which can then be converted back to the original image or run directly by adding the <code>-x</code> flag. This requires from one to three bytes for each pixel, plus three bytes extra for encoding the dimensions (length and width are encoded as 
twelve bits each, just in case 8 isn't enough for some reason.)</p>

<p>Of course, the encoding is somewhat lossy, as all other colors that don't have instructions assigned to them are changed to white (both to save space and because the specs guarantee that no instruction will ever be assigned to white.)</p>

<p><strong>One pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/9QBrC.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 200x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/aOVGc.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>When the red channel is zero, Golfical interprets the green and blue channels as an integer literal and stores it in the target of the pointer. Thus, this stores the value 255*256+255=65535 into the target of the pointer. This is the largest number that can be stored directly in this way, though cells can be set in longer ways to values as large as 2<sup>31</sup>-1.</p>

<p>In the binary encoding generated by the included Encoder utility, this would represented by three bytes; the encoding includes an optimization that allows only two bytes to be used for this instruction when the green channel is zero.</p>

<p><strong>Two pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/dRVeV.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 160x with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/7O7uI.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>(10,0,0) inputs a number and (10,1,1) outputs it as a character. In the compressed binary encoding, these two instructions add one byte each.</p>

<p><strong>Three pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/u4id2.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 160x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/GOyNd.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>(10,0,1) is like (10,0,0), except it reads a character instead of a number. (12,0,0) pushes the target of the pointer to the stack. (The binary encoding represents these instructions as 1 byte each.)</p>

<p>Therefore, this snippet reads a character, pushes it to the stack, and then reads another character.</p>

<p><strong>Four pixel example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/OiXDt.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 125x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/5Ydtv.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Simulates the rolling of a d100. The two new instructions here are 02xxxx (which works like 00xxxx but as an increment instead of an assignment) and 0D0001 (13,0,1) which sets the target of the pointer to a random integer between 0, inclusive, and its previous value, exclusive. Like 00xxxx, 02xxxx is represented in the encoding using two bytes if the green channel is zero or three otherwise. 0D0001 is represented as one byte.</p>

<p><strong>Five pixel example:</strong></p>

<p>It took me a while to decide what to do with this one, but eventually I decided to go with this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/pQmvX.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 125x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/jBpSq.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>(11,0,0) through (11,0,3) are absolute turn instructions (relative turn instructions, as well as many of the conditional relative turns, are later in the 11 block). (11,0,1) is East and (11,0,3) is West.</p>

<p>This program prints <code>lolololololololololololololololololo</code> ad infininum.</p>

<p><strong>Six Pixel Example</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/k9hJ9.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Magnified 200x, with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/G78T5.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>An infinite counter (limited, of course, by the 32-bit two's complement integer range; a proper infinite counter would be much harder to implement.) Also our first properly 2-dimensional example here.</p>

<p><strong>Eight pixel example:</strong></p>

<p>Magnified 100x with color labels:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/vHHUI.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A primality tester using the language's prime testing builtin (14,3,0), which makes a relative right turn if and only if the target of the pointer is prime. The official encoder program encodes this program in 13 bytes.</p>

<pre><code>[1, 2].each{|i|p i}
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby supports <code>for</code> loops, but the <code>.each</code> method is preferred. The code in brackets is a <strong>block</strong>, essentially a single-use anonymous function. Blocks can take parameters, which are enclosed in pipe characters. The <code>p</code> is a shortcut for <code>puts [something].inspect</code>. The <code>.inspect</code> method is a variation of <code>.to_s</code> which provides more details about the object.  </p>

<pre><code>%i[I love you too]
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create an array of symbols, the result would be: <code>[:I, :love, :you, :too]</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>

<pre><code>'1.34'[/(\.\d+)/]
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on creating snippet then parse it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expression</a>. This regular expression means get any dot <code>\.</code> that followed by one or more (<code>+</code>) digit (<code>\d</code>) then capture it. The result of this snippet is a new string containing <code>.34</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 16</strong></p>

<pre><code>'abcdefg'[3..-1]
</code></pre>

<p>This statement means, create a string containing <code>abcdefg</code>, then get the fourth (4th = <code>3</code>) character until the end (last = <code>-1</code>). Another example: <code>[3..3]</code> get the fourth character only (<code>d</code>), <code>[3..5]</code> get the fourth until sixth characters (<code>def</code>), <code>[-3..-1]</code> get the third last character until the last character (<code>efg</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Length 15</strong></p>

<pre><code>%w{i love you!}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a shortcut to create array of words (<code>string</code>), that is equal to <code>['i', 'love', 'you!']</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 14</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3,4]*'ab'
</code></pre>

<p>Array multiplication with a string equals to call a <code>.join</code> method, the result of this snippet is <code>1ab2ab3ab4</code>, that also equal to calling: <code>[1,2,3,4].join 'ab'</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 13</strong></p>

<pre><code>y=-&gt;x{x**3}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a <a href="http://pragdave.me/blog/2008/05/22/new-lambda-syntax-in-ruby-19/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>lambda</code></a> (or sometimes called anonymous function) using stab operator <code>-&gt;</code>. This statement means create an anonymous function that accept one parameter <code>x</code> that returns <code>x*x*x</code>, then assign this function to a variable named <code>y</code>. Any <code>lambda</code> can be called using <code>.call</code> method, for example:</p>

<pre><code>y = -&gt;(x){x**3}
y.call 8 # 512
</code></pre>

<p>This is equal to:</p>

<pre><code>y = lambda {|x| x**3}

<p><strong>Length 12</strong> (by <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/21164/devon-parsons">Devon Parsons</a>)</p>

<pre><code>puts "#{$$}"
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet shows a couple things. As shown below, <code>puts</code> writes to <code>STDOUT</code>. Code encapsulated in <code>#{ code_here }</code> is evaluated when the string is created, provided the string is made with double quotes. And ruby stores a bunch of useful global variables in double-character shorthand: For example, <code>$~</code> is the most recent regex match, and in this snippet, <code>$$</code> is the current process ID. So this snippet writes the current process' ID to <code>STDOUT</code>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the ID is of type <code>Fixnum</code>. The string interpolation automatically calls the <code>to_s</code> method on the evaluated code, and <code>to_s</code> by convention returns a string interpretation of the object.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>

<pre><code>x={a:1,b:2}
</code></pre>

<p>The statement above is one (of many way to create a <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hash</a> or commonly called associative array), to access the value, you can type <code>x[:a]</code>, where <code>:a</code> is a symbol (explained in <strong>Length 2</strong>). To set a value you can type <code>x[:key_name] = 'yayy'</code>. The key of a Hash could be anything not just symbol. Another popular way to create a Hash is using <code>=&gt;</code> symbol, for example:</p>

<pre><code>x = { 'a' =&gt; 123, 456 =&gt; [7,8,9], c: 'wow' }
# x['a'] == 123
# x[456] == [7,8,9]
# x[:c] == 'wow'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre><code>[*(8..11)]
</code></pre>

<p>In this snippet, that statement has the same effect as typing: <code>[8,9,10,11]</code>. The <code>8..11</code> part is called <code>Range</code> object. The <code>*</code> operator is the splat operator, in this part, the operator has the same effect as <code>.to_a</code> to array conversion <code>(8..11).to_a</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>def x;end
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a function, that example is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>def x
end
</code></pre>

<p>To fill the function content, you may type it before the <code>end</code> keyword, for example:</p>

<pre><code>def x
  puts 'the x function has been called'
  123
end
</code></pre>

<p>Anything that typed before <code>end</code> keyword would be returned, so in this statement <code>y = x</code>, the <code>y</code> variable would contain <code>123</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>

<pre><code>9.to_s(2)
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to perform base conversion from base-10 integer to binary number, the result would be <code>1001</code>. You can change number <code>2</code> into another base, and <code>.to_i</code> can have parameters too, to parse from <code>string</code> to number, for example <code>'1101'.to_i(2)</code> that would return <code>13</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>__END__
</code></pre>

<p><code>__END__</code> is a line keyword that denotes the end of regular source code, the lines below that line wont be executed and would be gathered in <code>DATA</code> string constant.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>rescue
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rescue</code> keyword is Ruby's keyword to catch raised exception, we could use this as one-line, for example: <code>x = 1/0 rescue 2</code>, that would set <code>x</code> into <code>2</code>, or we could use it within <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> keyword, for example:</p>

<pre><code>begin
  1/0
rescue ZeroDivisionError
  puts 'zero division detected
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can find more information about ZeroDivisionError <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/ZeroDivisionError.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
</code></pre>

<p><code>BEGIN</code> is a keyword that will execute following code-block before anything else withint the script, for example <code>puts 'b'; BEGIN { puts 'a' }</code> would give an output: <code>a</code> then <code>b</code>. There are also <code>END</code> keyword that executes next code-block before program termination.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>puts
</code></pre>

<p>This function would print a newline on the console, if you add anything as parameter for example: <code>puts('A')</code> or <code>puts 'A'</code>, this would print an <code>A</code> character then a newline.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>

<pre><code>'A'
</code></pre>

<p>Single quote is one way to create a string, there are another way such as double quote, always use single quote for better performance when no <a href="http://rors.org/2008/10/26/dont-escape-in-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interpolation</a> needed. To get the code-point value of a single string, use <code>.ord</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>:x

<pre><code>#--repl
</code></pre>

<p>This starts the REPL, which is like a infinite prompt for code.  But the stack is persistent, and implicit output always applies.</p>

<hr>

<p>At this point in time, many changes were made to Fuzzy Octo Guacamole, including a REPL, implicit output and the <code>X</code> command.  </p>

<p>The older snippets are staying the same, but I am adding a new alternative snippet for each length.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Length 8:</h1>

<pre><code>$--!++[*]
</code></pre>

<p>This works either as a function (add a <code>^</code> before), or in the REPL. (type the number, hit enter, paste this, hit enter).</p>

<h1>Length 9:</h1>

<pre><code>2pP*.2P**
</code></pre>

<p>This calculates the area and circumference of a circle, assuming each stack has the input already. In the REPL, this can be done with <code>^C</code>.  The results are left on the stacks.</p>

<h1>Length 10:</h1>

<pre><code>22^p2^pSpX
</code></pre>

<p>Output the product of the difference and the sum of two inputs, squared.  <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/240?m=33020419#33020419">(From a CMC (chat-mini-challenge) by Conor O'Brien)</a></p>

<p><code>2</code> pushes 2 to the stack, then <code>2^</code> pushes 2 and gets input and <code>p</code> raises it to the 2nd power (because of that 2 we pushed).  </p>

<p>The same is done again with the <code>2^p</code>. </p>

<p>Then we subtract the squared numbers we got, and square them (using that first <code>2</code> we pushed at the beginning). Finally, <code>X</code> peeks and pops.</p>

<p>This uses the difference of squares formula, <code>(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 11:</h1>

<pre><code>"Hello, "^j
</code></pre>

<p>Prints <code>Hello, &lt;input&gt;</code>. Pretty simple.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Oasis is a language made by Adnan specialized in number sequences.</p>

<p>You can try it online <a href="http://oasis.tryitonline.net/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>n

<p>Not very interesting, just push <code>n</code> (The current argument) and print it because implicit output.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>n1
</code></pre>

<p>Same as the previous snippet, but give <code>1</code> for the argument <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Oasis programs can have a list of hardcoded definitions for special cases.</p>

<p>So <code>n1</code> can be described in pseudocode as:</p>

<pre><code>A(n) = n
A(0) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Special cases and indexes are reversed, so to make</p>

<pre><code>A(0) = 1
A(1) = 4
</code></pre>

<p>The correct special cases definition is <code>41</code></p>

<p>As @Adnan pointed it out, another interesting snippet is the fibonnaci sequence:</p>

<pre><code>+T
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>T</code> is replaced with <code>10</code>, so this is expanded to</p>

<pre><code>+10
</code></pre>

<p>Which mean</p>

<pre><code>A(n) = A(n - 1) + A(n - 2)
A(0) = 0
A(1) = 1

<div id="pu88" class="pu"><h1>Microscript</h1>

<p>Microscript is a <s>new expiremental</s> golfing language I've been working on <s>recently</s>. For my <em>Death By Shock Probe</em> challenge, I was able to write a program that would have beaten out the leading Pyth entry by one byte, except for the fact that the language is too new to be eligible to actually compete in that challenge.</p>

<p>It uses a pair of stacks to manipulate data, and currently has just over 30 distinct commands</p>

<p>The esolangs wiki article can be found <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Microscript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Length 0 snippet:</strong></p>

<p>The empty program prints 0, followed by a newline. This is because the main register is initially 0, and printing is implicit unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong> <code>p</code></p>

<p>Prints the contents of the register to the output, followed by a newline. On end of execution, this will be done automatically, unless execution was halted by the <code>h</code> command.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet:</strong> <code>99</code></p>

<p>Any positive integer literal not part of another command will increment the main register by that value. Thus, unless part of another command, this will add 99 to the value in said register.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong> <code>is*</code></p>

<p>Currently the shortest example program on the esolangs wiki article. Takes in an input and squares it. <code>i</code> takes a number from the input and writes it to the register, <code>s</code> pushes it to the stack (unlike in HSPAL, this does not zero the register), and <code>*</code> pops it off the stack again and multiplies it by the value in the register, writing the result to the register. Then, as mentioned above, the new value is printed implicitly.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong> <code>isi+</code></p>

<p>Another example program from the esolangs wiki article. Takes two inputs and outputs their sum.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong> <code>'~Pph</code></p>

<p><code>'&lt;any character&gt;</code> is the language's equivalent of a character literal. <code>P</code> prints as a character while <code>p</code> prints as an integer. Finally, <code>h</code> halts immediately without the implicit printing. Therefore, the output from this is <code>~126</code>. This is technically equivalent to the shorter (3 byte) <code>'~P</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 Snippet:</strong> <code>i{z1p}</code></p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Truth-machine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">truth machine</a> which converts values not in {0,1} to 1. The closing bracket is optional in this case, but I already had a length 5 snippet. <code>{}</code> is the equivelent of BrainF***'s <code>[]</code>; Microscript uses square brackets for other purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 Snippet:</strong> <code>20ec1r4</code></p>

<p>Simulates the rolling of 1,048,576 four-sided dice. This is what would have been the winning entry for my afformentioned <em>Death By Shock Probe</em> challenge had Microscript come out a short time earlier. The <code>c</code> command was the language's first form of iteration- essentially "zero the register, then repeat the following a number of times equalling the value that was in the register before it was zeroed". <code>1</code> increments by 1, and <code>r4</code> increments by a random integer on [0,4). Lastly, <code>e</code> is a base-2 exponential function while <code>E</code> is the base-10 equivalent. Thus, <code>10Ec1r4</code> (or, equivalently, <code>1EEc1r4</code>) would simulate the rolling of <em>ten billion</em> four-sided dice. Eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong> <code>1{I[h]fan</code></p>

<p>A <code>cat</code> program that terminates on the first empty line (as the language currently lacks EOF detection)</p>

<p><strong>Length 11 snippet:</strong> <code>0"Caxq"Caxq</code></p>

<p>A reverse quine, and it's even one byte shorter than the one in the esolang article</p>

<p><strong>hansl</strong> is a programming language that is used in the statistical software project <a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">gretl</a> since 2001. It resembles a mixture of R, Stata, and C. It operates with datasets, time series, vectors, matrices, and functions. Just as in R, there are dozens of user-written packages for econometrics and data analysis. It is a matrix-oriented interpreted language that is Turing-complete (!). Its fortes are econometric estimation and numerical maximisation, and it can be integrated with R, Ox, Octave, Stata, Python, Julia, and gnuplot.</p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>

<p>You know how difficult it can be to build matrices from vectors? One can attain the effect by reading the input row-wise, column-wise, or through assembling the mess into a dataset? In hansl, you do not hassle: just write <code>~</code> between the two vectors, and voila, you get them bound <s>in tight leather</s> together vertically: <code>A~B</code>. Do you have two matrices you want to assemble? <code>X~Y</code>, easy as pie.</p>

<p>This is probably the most frequently used estimation method in all of econometrics.

<pre><code>a
</code></pre>

<p>Pip's default method of getting input is by command-line arguments (hereinafter "cmdline args"). The first five args are assigned to the variables <code>a</code> through <code>e</code>, and the whole list is assigned to <code>g</code>.</p>

<p>Since it is at the end of the program, the expression <code>a</code> is auto-printed. So this program outputs the first cmdline arg.</p>

<h3><a href="http://pip.tryitonline.net/#code=L3E&amp;input=MjU" rel="nofollow">Length 2</a></h3>

<pre><code>/q
</code></pre>

<p>To get input from stdin, use the <code>q</code> special variable. Every time it is referenced, it reads a line of input.</p>

<p>Many operators have both binary and unary versions. This is expected behavior for operators like <code>-</code>, and makes good sense for others like <code>^</code> split and <code>J</code> join. Here we have a somewhat unusual example: unary <code>/</code> inverts its argument. Inputting <code>4</code> will give <code>0.25</code> as output, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This snippet also demonstrates a feature that Pip shares with Perl and PHP: numbers are strings and strings are numbers. Both are represented by a data type called Scalar. Upshot: you don't have to convert <code>q</code>'s line of input to a number before doing math with it.</p>

<p>But what happens if you input something that's not a number, like <code>Hello world</code>? In a numeric context, it's treated as <code>0</code>. Dividing by <code>0</code>, like most error conditions, returns the special <em>nil</em> value, which produces no output when printed. If you want to see what went wrong, you can use the <code>-w</code> flag to enable warnings, in which case Pip will tell you:</p>

<pre><code>^g

<p>As mentioned above, <code>g</code> is a list of all cmdline ar<strong>g</strong>s. Many operators work itemwise on lists, and <code>^</code> (split) is one of them. This code splits the items of <code>g</code> into lists of characters.</p>

<p>If you ran this 2-byte code without the flag, it wouldn't be obvious what the program did, because Pip's default way of outputting lists is to concatenate the items together. To demonstrate that the split operation worked, we need to change the output format. About half of Pip's <a href="https://github.com/dloscutoff/pip/blob/master/Documentation/Command-line%20flags.md" rel="nofollow">command-line flags</a> have to do with list formatting. The <code>-p</code> flag applies <code>RP</code> (analogous to Python's <code>repr</code>) to the list before outputting it, making it easy to see the structure:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; python pip.py -pe "^g" 42 Hello
[[4;2];["H";"e";"l";"l";"o"]]
</code></pre>

<p>Use the TIO link above to play around with the other list flags (<code>-s</code>, <code>-n</code>, <code>-l</code>, <code>-P</code>, <code>-S</code>) and see how the output changes.</p>

<p>Lowercase letters <code>h</code> through <code>z</code> are global variables, preinitialized to different values. <code>z</code> is the lowercase alphabet; <code>h</code> is 100.</p>

<p>The <code>@&lt;</code> "left-of" operator returns a slice from the left end of an iterable (scalar, list, or range). It's equivalent to Python <code>iterable[:index]</code>--<em>except</em> that the Pip version works even when the index is greater than the length of the iterable. In that case it repeats the iterable until it's longer than the index, then takes the slice (like <code>take</code> + <code>cycle</code> in Haskell). So <code>z@&lt;h</code> gives the first 100 characters of the lowercase alphabet:</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Brachylog is a declarative logic programming language based on Prolog. Its name is constituted of the prefix <em>brachy-</em> (meaning <em>short</em>, from ancient greek <em>βραχύς</em>) and the suffix <em>-log</em>, to mark its link to Prolog.</p>
<h3>Length 1</h3>
<pre><code>r
</code></pre>
<p>A seemingly simple program, that is useful to understand some fundamental basics about Brachylog (and declarative programming in general): Reverse something.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, the program <code>r</code> is a main predicate consisting of one rule (namely, <code>r</code>). All rules in Brachylog implicitely start with the Input (noted <code>?</code>) and end with the Output (noted <code>.</code>).</p>
<p>Therefore, our program is really <code>?r.</code>, which can be read as <em>Output is the reverse of the Input</em>. The built-in <code>r - Reverse</code> works on the three main data types of Brachylog: <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=WzE6InRlc3QiOjI6IlBQQ0ciXQ&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lists</a>, <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strings</a> and <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=MTIzNDU&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integers</a>.</p>
<p>But more interestingly, it is a <em>relationship</em> that we state with <code>r</code>, not a one-way function like most programming languages. As such, <code>r</code> also works as expected <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cg&amp;input=Wg&amp;args=WzE6InRlc3QiOjI6IlBQQ0ciXQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">when the Output is ground and the Input is not!</a> It even works if both the input and the output have no value, though that doesn't show well on the online interpreter and with a program limited to one character.</p>
<p>We will continues to see in the next examples that predicates in Brachylog are relationships between variables and are as such much more expressive than traditional imperative function. We can also note that the Input and Output of predicates are merely called that because that's usually how those variables are used, but those are simply names and they don't mean that for example the Input necessarily has to be a ground variable.</p>
<h3>Length 2</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=cj8&amp;input=MTIzNDU0MzIx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>r?</pre></a></p>
<p>Now that we know that <code>r</code> is <em>reverse</em>, and that <code>?</code> is the Input, you can probably guess what this program does: test whether the input is a palindrome or not.</p>
<p>Indeed, <code>r?</code> is really <code>?r?.</code>, which can be read as: <em>Input is the reverse of the Input, and Output is the same as the Input</em>. Since we do not need the Output at all here, the second part of the sentence can be disregarded and we then see that it is indeed a palindromeness checking program.</p>
<p>The program <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=LnI&amp;input=&amp;args=MTIzNDU0MzIx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.r</code></a> would have worked the same if we passed our input through the Output variable.</p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>

<p>As you can see from the TIO link, the code above squares each element of the input. <code>^</code> being the squaring built-in predicate, and <code>a</code> being <em>Apply</em>, a <em>meta-predicate</em>.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, all predicates have only an input and an output argument. Therefore, when we need to &quot;pass&quot; more than one thing to the predicate, we put them in a list.</p>
<p>This is what we are doing with <code>:</code>, which is also the list separator. By writing <code>:^</code>, we are constructing the list <code>[Input, brachylog_power]</code>. So, just like numbers, strings and lists, we can also put <em>predicates</em> in lists.</p>
<p><em>Apply</em> takes the last element of its input argument as being a predicate, and queries that predicate each time with an element of the rest of its input argument as input (hence why it is called a meta-predicate). The output of <em>apply</em> accumulates the outputs of the queries. This predicate is usually called <code>map</code> in other languages (<code>maplist</code> in Prolog).</p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OkBbZg&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>:@[f</pre></a></p>
<p>Continuing on meta-predicates, here is <code>f</code>: <em>Findall</em>. As its name suggests, this will find all valid outputs of a predicate for a specific input.</p>
<p>Here, the input to <em>Findall</em> is the list <code>[Input, brachylog_string_prefix]</code>. The predicate <em>string_prefix</em> <code>@[</code> is true if its output is a prefix of the input. By running <em>Findall</em> on it, we will obtain all prefixes of <code>?</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>string</em> in <em>string_prefix</em> only comes from the fact that it is a 2 symbols predicate which starts with <code>@</code> (which represent operations that are more often done on strings). This predicate of course doesn't only work on strings, but also on integers and lists.</p>
<h3>Length 5</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OkxjLnI&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>:Lc.r</pre></a></p>
<p>This is probably my favorite Brachylog program (most likely because <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/77095/palindromizing-the-strings">it is twice as short as the Jelly answer on this challenge!</a>). This is a program which palindromizes its input.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, strings and integers can contain variable characters/digits, just like how lists can contain variables as elements. Therefore, <code>:Lc.</code> means <em>“Output is the result of concatenating the Input and a variable <code>L</code>”</em>. Then, we impose with <code>.r</code> that the output reversed is still the output (thus, that the output is a palindrome). This will force Brachylog to <strong>unify</strong> the variable values of <code>L</code> so that the output is indeed a palindrome.</p>
<h3>Length 6</h3>

~c
</pre></a></p>
<p>Here is another example of the use of <code>f - Findall</code> and <code>c - Concatenate</code>.</p>
<p>The first line is the main predicate and states <em>“Find all valid outputs of predicate 1 given the Input as input”</em>. The second line is predicate 1 and states <code>The output, when concatenated, results in the Input</code>.</p>
<p>Here, <code>~</code> is a simple control symbol which &quot;flips&quot; the arguments of the following predicate: <code>AcZ</code> means “<code>Z</code> is the result of concatenating the elements of <code>A</code>” whereas <code>A~cZ</code> means “concatenating the elements of <code>Z</code> results in <code>A</code>”.</p>
<p>Therefore the program above will find all possible lists of strings (excluding the ones containing the empty string), which when concatenated will result in the input.</p>
<p>Note that <code>~c</code> is not a second built-in which does the reverse of <code>c</code> ; it <strong>is</strong> the same as <code>c</code>, but called with swapped arguments. To convince you of this, <a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OjFmCiwuYz8s&amp;input=InRlc3Qi&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rewriting predicate 1 as <code>,.c?,</code> will result in the same program</a>.</p>
<p>Side note: this program could have been written <code>:{~c}f</code>, which does the exact same thing. Choosing one or the other is mostly a matter of preference.</p>
<h3>Length 7</h3>
<p><a href="http://brachylog.tryitonline.net/#code=OjF5CiNwPQ&amp;input=MTAw&amp;args=Wg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><pre>:1y
#p=</pre></a></p>
<p>This demonstrates another meta-predicate: <code>y - Yield</code>, and a major feature of Brachylog: constraints-based arithmetic.</p>
<p><code>y - Yield</code> is a meta predicate very similar to <code>f - Findall</code>, the difference between the two being that <code>y</code> will unify its output with the first <code>N</code> outputs of the queried predicate (<code>N</code> being the penultimate element of the input arguments), instead of all of the outputs. This is thus very useful for predicates that have an infinite number of choice points, such as arithmetic series.</p>
<p>In Brachylog, all integer arithmetic is based on <strong>constraints</strong>. This makes operations on integers very declarative in nature ; if we declare the relationship that <code>X + Y = Z</code> (which in Brachylog would be written as <code>X:Y+Z</code>), then this constraint will hold even if those variables have no ground value. Adding more and more constraints will keep on reducing the search space for the possible values of those variables. Then, the labeling process (using <code>=</code> in Brachylog) will assign values to variables such that they respect all constraints that were applied to them.</p>
<p><code>#p - constraint_prime</code> is a predicate which constrains its input <code>?</code> (which is unified with its output <code>.</code>) such that it must be a prime number. Using <code>= - Equals</code>, we can then label that variable so that it takes a ground value. The labeling process will order choice points according to the magnitude of the values, which is why overall this program yields the first <code>N</code> prime numbers, starting from <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, this does exactly the same thing as the previous 7 bytes program. This one though is much more easier to describe and understand.</p>
<p>We use <code>~l</code> to get a list whose length is the Input. We then impose with <code>&lt;</code> that the list must contain integers and must be strictly increasing. Using <code>Apply</code>, <code>:#pa</code> then constrains each integer of the list to be a prime number. We then use <code>=</code> to label the values of that list, which results in a strictly increasing list of prime numbers.</p>

<p>This program computes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root" rel="nofollow noreferrer">digital root</a> of its input.</p>
<p>Just like in Prolog, we can write multiple rules for a single predicate, using <code>|</code>: the first rule <code>#0</code> constrains the Input = the Ouput to be a single digit. If this is not possible, the second rule <code>@e+:0&amp;</code> will split the input as a list of digits, then sum them and call Predicate 0 (the main predicate) recursively.</p>

<h2>0-vote</h2>

<p>eacal is a language made by me in 2016. It's very extremely verbose, but, as I hope, is capable. There is one command per line, and each data entry is separated by spaces. It is meant to be classified under a lot of programming paradigms, which includes right now, imperative, structured, stack-based, object oriented, event-driven, and a tad of functional.</p>

<p>Fun fact: the empty program errors.</p>

<h2>1-vote</h2>

<pre><code>v
</code></pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>eacal is currently running.
</code></pre>

<p>This tells you if eacal is still alive. Helpful!</p>

<h2>2-vote</h2>

<pre><code>on
</code></pre>

<p>This is the event-driven portion of eacal. It's syntax is:</p>

<pre><code>on &lt;event&gt; &lt;code evaluating to a function&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>on end eval print string Done!

print string Running...
</code></pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>Running...
Done!
</code></pre>

<h2>3-vote</h2>

<pre><code>arg
</code></pre>

<p>This returns all of the command-line arguments passed to the program. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>node eacal.js &lt;file&gt; 3 4 Hello
</code></pre>

<p>File:</p>

<pre><code>print arg
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>[ '3', '4', 'Hello' ]
</code></pre>

<h2>4-vote</h2>

<pre><code>init
</code></pre>

<p>This is used to initialize stacks, like so:</p>

<pre><code>init main
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the stack does not exist.</p>

<h2>5-vote</h2>

<pre><code>alias
</code></pre>

<p>This sets creates a command that function the same as another command. Example:</p>

<pre><code>alias define_stack init
define_stack main
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>

<pre><code>init main
</code></pre>

<p>This is very helpful in golfing.</p>

<h2>6-vote</h2>

<pre><code>string
</code></pre>

<p>Represents a string, where it's arguments are joined by spaces. So, <code>Hello, World!</code> is this:</p>

<pre><code>string Hello, World!
</code></pre>

<h2>7-vote</h2>

<pre><code>numlist
</code></pre>

<p>This returns an array of numbers representative of its arguments. For the first few Fibonacci numbers in a list:</p>

<pre><code>numlist 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
</code></pre>

<h2>8-vote</h2>

<pre><code>func add
</code></pre>

<p>This shows some of eacal's function programming. You can execute it on a stack named <code>k</code> using <code>exec k--func add</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>init main
push main number 5
push main number 8
print exec main--func add
; outputs 13
</code></pre>

<p>I will be focusing on features/snippets of/from ES6 standard in this answer. Some snippets require knowledge of topics previously presented, so you may want to read this bottom-to-top.</p>
<p><strong>Length 17 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>&quot;𠮷&quot;.codePointAt()
</code></pre>
<p>More Unicode support! <code>.codePointAt()</code> is a Unicode-compliant version of <code>.charCodeAt()</code>. For example, if you were to take</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>&quot;𠮷&quot;.charCodeAt()
</code></pre>
<p>you would find <code>55362</code>. This might seem right, but if you convert it to hexadecimal, you would find that it corresponds to U+D842. Looking on <a href="http://graphemica.com" rel="noreferrer">Graphemica</a>, we can see that the character is actually <a href="http://graphemica.com/%F0%A0%AE%B7" rel="noreferrer">U+20BB7</a>. U+D842 is one of the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U.2B10000_to_U.2B10FFFF" rel="noreferrer">surrogates</a> that makes up the UTF-16 representation of that character.</p>
<p>But enough of these details: the point of <code>.codePointAt()</code> is to find the actual Unicode point of the character. <code>&quot;𠮷&quot;.codePointAt()</code> is <code>134071</code>, or U+20BB7—the correct result. Finally Unicode lovers can use JavaScript!</p>
<p><strong>Length 16 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>/^.$/u.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Another nice feature of ES6 is proper Unicode support! If you tried this code in ES5:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>alert(/^.$/.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>You might be surprised to find that the answer is <code>false</code>! The problem here is in JavaScript's default encoding, UTF-16: characters above U+FFFF are actually represented as 2 chars, called &quot;surrogates&quot;. (You can learn more about this on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U.2B10000_to_U.2B10FFFF" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.) In order to fix this, you need a more complex regex:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>alert(/^(?:[\uD800-\uDBFF][\uDC00-\uDFFF]|.)$/.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>ES6 introduces the <code>u</code> flag on regexes. When <code>u</code> is set, characters above U+FFFF are still captured as a single char. So <code>/^.$/u.test(&quot;𠮷&quot;)</code> returns the correct result: <code>true</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 15 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>String.raw`q\n`
</code></pre>
<p>Back to tagged templates! ES6 comes with a function all set up to be used as a tag: <code>String.raw</code>. This returns the raw text you typed in the template (replacing interpolations with their values), so the above snippet is equalivalent to <code>&quot;q\\n&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 14 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Number.EPSILON
</code></pre>
<p>As you may know, JavaScript's numbers are not arbitrary-precision; they have exactly 53 bits of precision. This can cause problems when trying to add decimal numbers:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var point3 = 0.1 + 0.2;
alert(point3 === 0.3); // false!
</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is that neither <code>0.1</code> nor <code>0.2</code> can be represented exactly in binary, and when adding them together, the least significant bit is rounded the wrong way, resulting in <code>0.30000000000000004</code> instead of <code>0.3</code>.</p>
<p><code>Number.EPSILON</code> was added as a workaround to this problem; it is equal to 2<sup>-53</sup>, the smallest number that can be added to 1 without rounding back down to 1. We can use this to create a new equals function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>equals = (num1, num2) =&gt; Math.abs(num1 - num2) &lt; Number.EPSILON;

alert(equals(point3, 0.3)); // true!
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray for ES6!</p>
<p><strong>Length 13 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>s=&gt;s.split` `
</code></pre>
<p>What is this? A function call without parentheses? Actually, it's another use of template literals: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals" rel="noreferrer">tagged templates</a>! But what is actually happening here?</p>
<p>When you tag a template with a function, it calls the function as usual, but it passes in the arguments a little differently. Take this example function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function parseMe(strings, name, age) {
  alert(`Your name is ${ name } and you are ${ age } years old`);
  console.log(&quot;We don't need these strings:&quot;, strings);
}

myName = &quot;Bob&quot;;
myAge = 123;
parseMe `Hello, I'm ${ myName } and I've orbited the earth ${ myAge } times.`;
</code></pre>
<p>This alerts <code>Your name is Bob and you are 123 years old</code>. Why? When calling a function with a tagged template, JavaScript passes each <code>${ }</code> value as a separate parameter, groups the strings into an array which is passed before everything else. So you're really calling <code>parseMe</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>parseMe( [&quot;Hello, I'm &quot;, &quot; and I've orbited the earth &quot;, &quot;times.&quot;], myName, myAge );
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, right? Now back to the original snippet. Now we can see that it could be written like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>s=&gt;s.split([&quot; &quot;])
</code></pre>
<p><code>.split</code> coerces its argument to a string before splitting. The string representation of <code>[&quot; &quot;]</code> is <code>&quot; &quot;</code>, so the function could be written yet another way:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>s=&gt;s.split(&quot; &quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And this simply splits the text on spaces, which splits it into words. Isn't ES6 awesome?</p>
<p><strong>Length 12 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>n=&gt;`Hi
${n}`
</code></pre>
<p>Introducing...template literals! Yet another super-helpful ES6 feature. These act like strings for the most part, but you can include newlines without escaping them. Not only that, but you can also use interpolation! If you run the above function with input <code>&quot;JavaScript&quot;</code>, it will output this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Hi
JavaScript
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 11 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[a,b]=[b,a]
</code></pre>
<p>Tired of using that old <code>var tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp;</code> trick to swap variables? Now you don't have to! Using destructuring, you can swap those two variables quickly and concisely with the above statement.</p>
<p><strong>Length 10 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[a,...b]=b
</code></pre>
<p>Destructuring! Yay! This is one of the cooler features of ES6. You can use it to do many things that would have taken a lot more bytes in ES5. For example, this is what the above statement corresponds to in ES5:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>a=b[0],b=b.slice(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, <code>a=b.unshift()</code> works too, but consider when you want to grab the first three items:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[x,y,z,...b]=b
x=b.unshift(),y=b.unshift(),z=b.unshift()
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you don't want to change the value of <code>b</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>[x,y,z]=b
x=b[0],y=b[1],z=b[2]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, destructuring is shorter, more readable, and just all-around better.</p>
<p><strong>Length 9 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>new Set()
</code></pre>
<p>Another useful data-type that JavaScript now supports is Sets! You can create a set like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var myArray = [1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 1];
var mySet = new Set(myArray);
// Set [ 1, 3, 6, 2 ]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, creating a Set out of an array removes all duplicate items. You can turn it back into an array with the spread operator:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>myArray = [...mySet];
// [ 1, 3, 6, 2 ]
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this trick on strings:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var myString = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
var mySet = new Set(myString);
myString = [...mySet].join(&quot;&quot;);
// &quot;Helo, Wrd!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that the Set constructor must be called with <code>new</code>, and only works on the first argument. For example, this won't work:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var mySet = new Set(1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 1);
// TypeError: 1 is not iterable
</code></pre>
<p>You can learn all about Sets on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" rel="noreferrer">this page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Length 8 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>(i=0)=&gt;i
</code></pre>
<p>You probably understand what this example is: default parameters! JavaScript ES5 is really horrible with default values. Usually you can get away with this workaround:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function f(i) {
  i = i || 0;
  return i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this resets <code>i</code> if it is <em>anything</em> falsy (<code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>null</code>, or <code>undefined</code>). To just do <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, you have to be much more verbose:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function f(i) {
  if (typeof i === &quot;undefined&quot; || i === null)
    i = 0;
  return i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>But ES6 contains a new syntax for default values! Now you can shorten your code to this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function f(i = 0) {
  return i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or in ES6 arrow notation, <code>f=(i=0)=&gt;i</code>. When given an input, this just returns the input, but when called with no input, it returns <code>0</code>. This is very helpful in uncountable scenarios, and possibly one of the best additions of ES6.</p>
<p><strong>Length 6 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Symbol
</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript now supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol" rel="noreferrer">Symbols</a>! A symbol is created with <code>Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>, and every symbol created is different: <code>Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;) !== Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;)</code> The only way to keep a symbol is to assign it to a variable: <code>var sym = Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;); sym === sym</code></p>
<p>One of the most useful Symbols is <code>Symbol.iterator</code>. This is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator" rel="noreferrer">Generator</a> which is used whenever you iterate over an object, whether with for-in loops or the <code>...</code> operator (see below). For example, the following code defines an iterator for all Number objects:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Number.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = function* () {
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; this; i++)
        yield i;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>[...6]</code> returns <code>[0,1,2,3,4,5]</code>! Aren't generators fun?</p>
<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>const
</code></pre>
<p>This for a change is exactly what you've guessed! Its a new variable declaration syntax used for creating constant variables.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>const a = &quot;foo&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>a</code>'s value is fixed, any attempt to change it will lead to a <code>SyntaxError</code> (cos JS!). Not only that, if you skip the assignment part while declaring the variable, that will also lead to a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>const a;
// Exception: SyntaxError: missing = in const declaration

const a = &quot;foo&quot;;
a = &quot;bar&quot;;
// Exception: SyntaxError: invalid assignment to const a
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>...
</code></pre>
<p>Default arguments ? Java ? Nope! This is the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator" rel="noreferrer">spread operator</a> and it does exactly what it says.</p>
<p>For instance, you want to spread your array variable <code>A</code> into another array <code>B</code> in the middle alongside other things:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var B = [1, 2, 5, ...A, 8, 0];
</code></pre>
<p>That simple!</p>
<p>You can even do this with function calls or arguments.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function foo(a, b, ...c) {}
</code></pre>
<p>is a function whose first argument goes in <code>a</code>, second goes in <code>b</code> and rest all arguments (third, fourth ...) go in as an array in <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>Now if you want to call that function and all your arguments are in the array <code>A</code>, you can do it like</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>foo(...A);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Think that I put <em>greater than or equal to</em> sign the wrong way ? Think again! Think ES6!</p>
<p>This is one of the best features of ES6 - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions" rel="noreferrer">Fat arrow function</a> . Apart from reducing a lot of bytes while defining a function (<code>var a=_=&gt;_+_</code> instead of <code>var a = function(_){return _+_}</code>), arrow functions also change the behavior of <code>this</code> so that you don't have to <code>bind</code> the function again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>*
</code></pre>
<p>Multiplication ? Nope! Remember ES6! The <code>*</code> keywords is part of one of many syntax sugar + features of ES6 - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*" rel="noreferrer">Generators</a>. This is added to the <code>function</code> keyword to make the function a generator function.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>
<p>ES6 adds a lot of useful syntax sugar and features into the language inspired by a lot of other languages.</p>
<p>The most useful fact about ES6 is that due to the added syntax and features, it performs much better than ES5 (current generation JS across all browsers) in terms of <a href="/questions/tagged/code-golf" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;code-golf&#39;" rel="tag">code-golf</a>.</p>
<p>The final spec for ES6 was finalized in June 2015, and all major browsers (except IE) have enabled most of the new features.

<p>(whoops I forgot the link before :p)</p>

<h2>(pair of) Factoid(s):</h2>

<p>Dotsplit is a mostly syntax free language, with odd builtins (kind of like mathematica), but is currently in it's infancy. Dotsplit is named after the tokeniser used in the interpreter: <code>str.split()</code>. This is a weak tokeniser, but it fulfills all needs of the language, so far anyway.</p>

<h2>1 byte:</h2>

<pre><code>D
</code></pre>

<p><code>D</code> does</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>nothing. it isn't a tiny builtin, unless you count a nop as a builtin, and it's only a nop because it isn't a defined command. Dotsplit has relatively long command names for most things. Note that the shortest happens to be three long. anything that isn't a defined command is ignored. also note commands are case insensitive, so if it were a command, <code>d</code> would be the same as <code>D</code></p>

<h2>2 bytes:</h2>

<p>still not much interesting</p>

<pre><code> b
</code></pre>

<p>b with a leading space. This program functions identically to <code>b</code>, as well as <code>D</code>, because nops, but if <code>b</code> was a command, <code>b</code> and <code>D</code> would not be the same, but <code>b</code> and <code>[space]b</code> would. Spaces are used to separate commands, but otherwise are ignored. Next upvote, and we get an actual command!</p>

<h2>3 bytes</h2>

<p>First command!</p>

<pre><code>aDd
</code></pre>

<p>This will pop a and b, and push a+b. Popping from an empty stack yields 0.
hence, this program will leave one 0 on the stack. <code>add</code> is case insensitive, and will function regardless of case (<code>AdD</code> will also work)</p>

<h2>4 bytes</h2>

<p>There are a fair amount more commands with 4 bytes, not many still. I chose this one</p>

<pre><code>derp
</code></pre>

<p>This program will wait for input by the user. If input is "derp" (case-sensitive), it prints "Derp". Otherwise, "Nope"</p>

<p>Created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in 1995, Ruby is a dynamical object-oriented programming language. It's built/inspired by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.</p>

<p>Matz, speaking on the Ruby-Talk mailing list, May 12th, 2000.</p>

  <p>Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body</p>

In Ruby  everything is objects, so no primitives. Parentheses are also optional. Opening up for some interesting coding, but that doesn't mean that you have to avoid them.<br>
Is this really that readable?</p>

<p><code>puts array.delete hash.fetch :foo</code></p>

<p><strong>Snippet 1</strong><br>
Use the <code>$</code> to create global variables, but don't clutter the namespace please.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 2</strong><br>
To create a new hash, all you need to type is <code>{}</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 3</strong><br>
Ruby uses <code>nil</code> as a false value. So no need to do <code>var.nil?</code> everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 4</strong><br>
<code>puts</code> is used to print a string version of an object with a new line at the end. Short for "put string". Can also be shortened to just <code>p</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 5</strong><br>
To make Ruby even more powerful it handles closures. And with the use of <code>f.call</code> you can call/invoke a block or function. Pretty sweet. For those unfamiliar with closures. A closure can pass it around like an object (to be called later). It also remembers the values of all the variables that were in scope when the function was created. It can access those variables when it is called even though they may no longer be in scope.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 6</strong><br>
The snippet <code>class C</code> returns nil, and that is because everything in Ruby has a return value. You can even return multiple values.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 7</strong><br>
With the use of <code>include</code> Ruby support single inheritance. Making it easy to mixin modules.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 8</strong><br>
<code>x||=true</code> is one of several logical operators that Ruby supports. This one checks if x has been defined, and if not sets it to true.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 9</strong><br>
<code>Fo.new(x)</code> calls the class <code>Fo</code> initialize function, with the value of <code>x</code>. There is no constructor in Ruby so you are free to return what value you like from the <code>.new()</code> call.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 10</strong><br>
As mentioned earlier Ruby supports multiple return values, and it is easily done with <code>return x,y</code>. The values are returned as they are read, and if you have more return values then what you have for assigning the rest will be dropped. Using the <code>*</code> on the last variable will make an array and assign the rest of the return values to that array.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 11</strong><br>
RubyGems is the packet manager for Ruby started in November, 2003. Original a stand alone program, but as of Ruby 1.9 it is a part of the standard library.
Use the code snippet <code>gem install</code> and the name of the package (for example 'sinatra') to install it.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 12</strong><br>
<code>[1,2]&lt;&lt;[3,4]</code> The command '&lt;&lt;' pushes or append a object to the array. In our case the array [3,4] will be pushed 'into' the array [1,2], making it 'look' like this [1,2,[3,4]]. So it does not merge two arrays.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 13</strong><br>
<code>x.map{|y|y+1}</code> The map function iterates over the array 'x' and invokes the block given, and returning a new array with the modified values. In our case it will iterate over the values in the array and increment them with one.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 14</strong><br>
<code>x.map!{|y|y+1}</code> This snippet is similar to the previous one, but calls on the function map!. The '!'/exclamation mark tells the user that this function will modify the object calling it, often called destructive or dangerous functions.</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 15</strong><br>
The snippet <code>ARGV[0] ||false</code> checks if <code>ARGV[0]</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, if not it will return the <code>or</code> value, false. <code>ARGV</code> is an array containing the arguments sent in at start time. <code>ruby app.rb test</code> will give you 'test' in <code>ARGV[0]</code>.</p>

<div id="pu102" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/dloscutoff/Esolangs/tree/master/Ouroboros" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ouroboros</a></h1>

<p>Each line of an Ouroboros program represents a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" rel="nofollow noreferrer">snake eating its own tail</a>, with the beginning of the line being the head and the end being the tail. The only control flow operations are commands to eat or regurgitate characters of the tail. When the instruction pointer reaches the last part of the line that hasn't been eaten, it loops back to the beginning. To stop execution, simply swallow the instruction pointer.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Ouroboros has a <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/61624/16766">Stack Snippet interpreter</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>n
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs the top of the stack as a number. An empty stack is treated as if it contained infinite zeros, so this outputs <code>0</code>. No characters are ever eaten, so the program loops (and prints) infinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>1(
</code></pre>

<p>Pushes a <code>1</code> and then uses <code>(</code> to eat that many characters from the end of the snake. This means eating the last character. However, since that's where the instruction pointer currently is, the snake dies and the program terminates.</p>

<p>The program would also terminate if the number were <code>2</code>, or indeed any larger number; in that case the entire snake would be swallowed. (Physically impossible, but hey--this is a metaphor.)</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>32n
</code></pre>

<p>Although Ouroboros processes one character per tick, it still supports multi-digit numbers in the expected way. This program will push and output <code>32</code> infinitely (rather than, for instance, pushing <code>3</code>, pushing <code>2</code>, and outputting only the <code>2</code>).</p>

<p>One interesting side effect: a multi-digit number is recognized as such even when it bridges the end of the snake. The code <code>2n3</code> will first output <code>2</code>, but thereafter will output <code>32</code> infinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>rnao
</code></pre>

<p><code>r</code> reads a positive integer from input, grabbing all contiguous digits until it finds a non-digit. <code>n</code> outputs as a number. <code>a</code> pushes <code>10</code>, and <code>o</code> outputs this as a character (newline). Thus, an input of <code>1 2.3 -4abc55</code> will yield</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
4
55
</code></pre>

<p>However, because this snippet doesn't terminate the loop when the input is used up, the program will continue: <code>r</code> will start giving <code>-1</code>s to signal end-of-input, and <code>n</code> will keep outputting them indefinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>n?2*(
</code></pre>

<p>Prints one or more <code>0</code>s, with the exact count depending on random numbers.</p>

<p><code>n</code> behaves as in snippet 1, outputting a <code>0</code> from the empty stack. <code>?2*</code> generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1 and doubles it. Then <code>(</code> eats that many characters (rounded down). Thus, if <code>?</code> generated a number >= 0.5, the program halts; if not, it loops, prints another <code>0</code>, etc.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>"oooo(
</code></pre>

<p><code>"</code> toggles between executing characters and treating them as a string. As in other 2D languages, you can define a string using only one quote mark because the instruction pointer wraps around. A key difference with Ouroboros, however, is that the string is pushed in reverse order, so that the first character is on the top of the stack. This means we don't need to write strings backwards or have a stack-reverse operator like >&lt;> does.</p>

<p>The above code pushes <code>"oooo("</code> and outputs the first four characters (the <code>o</code>s). It then uses the last number remaining on the stack (<code>40</code>, the charcode of <code>(</code>) as the argument to the <code>(</code> command. Eating 40 characters definitely swallows the IP, and the program halts.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>r.*.n!(
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62785/16766">Truth machine program.</a></p>

<p><code>r</code> reads a number from input, or -1 for EOF. <code>.*</code> multiplies it by itself, keeping 0 and 1 the same but mapping -1 to 1. <code>.n</code> dups and outputs the number. Finally, <code>!(</code> logically negates and  eats that many characters of the end of the snake. If the number was <code>0</code>, this eats the <code>(</code> and dies. If the number was <code>1</code>, this eats zero characters, and execution loops back to the beginning of the snake, printing <code>1</code> indefinitely.</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>i.0&lt;2*(o
</code></pre>

<p>Cat program.</p>

<p><code>i</code> reads a single character from input, pushing its charcode (or -1 on EOF). <code>.0&lt;</code> duplicates and tests if the value was less than 0; i.e., pushes 1 on EOF and 0 otherwise. <code>2*(</code> multiplies by 2 and swallows that many characters. On EOF, this eats <code>(o</code> and ends the program; otherwise, nothing is eaten, and <code>o</code> outputs the character from input. The snake then loops back to the beginning.</p>

<p>In writing this snippet, I realized that cat <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/62379/16766">can actually be done in four characters</a>: <code>i.)o</code>. Go read the explanation on that answer for some crazy abuse of undefined behavior.</p>

<p><em>(Length 9 snippet pending)</em></p>

<h3>Length 10</h3>

<pre><code>.!+.@.nao+
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs the Fibonacci sequence, starting from 0 and continuing indefinitely.</p>

<p>First, we need to initialize the stack by pushing a <code>1</code>. The trouble is that any initialization code at the head of a snake will run <em>every</em> time through (since it's at the head, we have no way of eating it). Therefore <code>.!+</code> is designed to turn the top of the stack into a <code>1</code> iff it was previously <code>0</code> (which is the case when the stack is empty). <code>.!</code> dups and logically negates (<code>1</code> if the value was <code>0</code>, otherwise <code>0</code>), and <code>+</code> adds that result to the top value.</p>

<p>(For a version that uses a second snake to perform the initialization, see the GitHub readme.)</p>

<p>Now the bulk of the program. Call the two numbers on the stack <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, where <code>x</code> is smaller and <code>y</code> is on the top of the stack. <code>.@.n</code> copies <code>y</code>, rotates <code>x</code> to the top, and outputs a copy of it. <code>ao</code> outputs a newline (as in snippet 4), and <code>+</code> adds <code>x</code> to a copy of <code>y</code>. Now the stack contains <code>y</code> and <code>x+y</code>, and we proceed to the next iteration.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu103" class="pu"><h1>Prolog</h1>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Prolog is one of the first and most popular logic programming language. </p>

<p>Since Prolog is a declarative language based on first-order logic, programs in it can be surprisingly elegant, or devilishly mindbending.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In Prolog programming (in contrast, perhaps, to life in general) our goal is to fail as quickly as possible.” — <em>The Art of Prolog</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>X
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, any identifier that starts with an uppercase letter is a <em>variable</em>, which initially has no value. Unlike most programming languages, variables in Prolog can only take a value <em>once</em> (we say that the variable gets <em>unified</em> with something). After unification, a variable cannot be updated (unless backtracking occurs… more on that later). Variables only get a type once they are unified (the type of what they get unified with), therefore a <em>free</em> variable can be unified with anything.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>X.
</code></pre>

<p>This is a valid query in Prolog. Unlike most languages, in prolog you run queries (like in SQL), and the Prolog execution engine will attempt to satisfy that query. In particular, it will unify variables along the way if those unifications make the query true. Each query ends with a period.</p>

<p>Here however, the query is not really meaningful, since we are asking Prolog to check that a free variable <code>X</code> is true, and it is for an infinite number of different unifications (any integer for instance would make this true). Therefore, here is what SWI-Prolog answers to that query:</p>

<pre><code>% ... 1,000,000 ............ 10,000,000 years later
% 
%       &gt;&gt; 42 &lt;&lt; (last release gives the question)
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>nl.
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, any identifier that starts with a lowercase letter is called an <em>atom</em>. They can be used to name predicates, facts, or simply as string-like objects. Here, <code>nl/0</code> is a predicate which has 0 arguments (hence the <code>/0</code> notation) and which is a built-in in Prolog. This predicate simply prints a line break to <code>STDOUT</code>:</p>

<pre><code>?- nl.

true.
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that Prolog really likes to print <code>true.</code> when it manages to satisfy your query (or <code>false.</code> when it doesn't).</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>X=0.
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, <code>=</code> is unification. Prolog will satisty this query by unifying <code>X</code> with <code>0</code>, which is the only possible way of satisfying it.</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>X=[].
</code></pre>

<p>In Prolog, the list is a central data structure that you will use constantly. All lists are written in square brackets. A special list that will show up very often (particularly when writing your recursion termination condition) is the empty list, noted <code>[]</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>X=3+B.
</code></pre>

<p>Prolog is homoiconic, and as such the above query is perfectly valid. The REPL returns the following:</p>

<pre><code>X = 3+B.
</code></pre>

<p>In short, we are unifying variable <code>X</code> with the expression <code>3+B</code> (which does not get evaluated in any way). If we now unify <code>B</code> with something, this will be reflected in <code>X</code>:</p>

<pre><code>?- X=3+B, B=5.
X = 3+5,
B = 5.
</code></pre>

<p>(As you can see, <code>X</code> is not evaluated to <code>8</code>)</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>X*X#=4
</code></pre>

<p>Here I am cheating slightly. To make the above work, you must first run the following query: <code>use_module(library(clpfd)).</code>. This is the constraint logic programming in finite domains (CLPFD) library, which allows us to do very powerful things: for instance, the REPL will return the following for the above query:</p>

<pre><code>X in -2\/2.
</code></pre>

<p><code>\/</code> represents the union of two domains. Therefore, what Prolog is telling use here is that for <code>X</code> to satisfy <code>X*X = 4</code> (the <code>#</code> in the query is CLPFD's syntax for constraints), <code>X</code> must be either -2 or 2.</p>

<p>This is a very powerful mechanism that allows to write constraints on variables, without specifying how to find the values that satisfy them. Writing something like a sudoku solver with this library is thus extremely easy: you only have to describe the constraints between cells, and the starting clues. Prolog will then find solutions for you!</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>X=2;X=9.
</code></pre>

<p>Prolog is a logic programming language, and as such you expect to be able to use disjunctions. This is exactly what <code>;</code> (<em>Or</em>) does: <code>X</code> unifies with <code>2</code> <em>OR</em> <code>X</code> unifies with <code>5</code>. When running this in Prolog's REPL, we get the following:</p>

<pre><code>?- X=3;X=9.
X = 3
</code></pre>

<p>The REPL halts after printing you this answer, instead of finishing and waiting for a new query. Indeed, Prolog thinks there are other possible answers (and there is one in this case), and so it is waiting to see if you are interested in those. By pressing <code>;</code>, it will give you another answer:</p>

<pre><code>?- X=3;X=9.
X = 3 ;
X = 9.
</code></pre>

<p>which is what we expected to get. Here, Prolog knows there are no other possible answers for what we queried, so it will finish and wait for another query.</p>

<p>The mechanism behind this is called <em>backtracking</em>: when Prolog choses to unify <code>X</code> with <code>2</code>, it remembers that it made that choice when in fact there are other possibilities (here, unifying <code>X</code> with <code>9</code>). When we ask for another answer (or if the query had failed after that choice), it will backtrack to the last choice it made and try another one, until no other choice is available.</p>

<h3>Length 9</h3>

<pre><code>a(ax+b).
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a fact, that constitutes your source code. We can make some interesting queries on that fact, to check out Prolog's pattern matching mechanism (remember that identifiers starting with an uppercase letter are free variables):</p>

<pre><code>?- a(X).
X = ax+b.
</code></pre>

<p>Cooler:</p>

<pre><code>?- a(X+b).
X = ax.
</code></pre>

<p>Even cooler:</p>

<pre><code>?- a(X+Y).
X = ax,
Y = b.
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 12</h3>

<pre><code>length(L,3).
</code></pre>

<p><code>length/2</code> is a built-in predicate of Prolog which is true if its first argument is a list of length its second argument. Here, we are setting the second argument as a ground integer, and the first as a variable. Thus, we get the following behavior:</p>

<pre><code>?- length(L,3).
L = [_G1500, _G1503, _G1506].
</code></pre>

<p>That is, for that query to be true, <code>L</code> must be a list of 3 elements; those elements are <code>_G1500</code>, <code>_G1503</code> and <code>_G1506</code> which are variables (those names are internal variable names).</p>

<p>We can also run that predicate with both arguments as variables, and get the following very powerful behavior:</p>

<pre><code>?- length(L,M).
L = [],
M = 0 ;
L = [_G1512],
M = 1 ;
L = [_G1512, _G1515],
M = 2 ;
L = [_G1512, _G1515, _G1518],
M = 3 ;
L = [_G1512, _G1515, _G1518, _G1521],
M = 4 ;

<div id="pu104" class="pu"><h1>QBasic</h1>

<p>The programming language that everybody grew up on<sup>[citation needed]</sup>--at least, everyone who grew up with MS-DOS during the 90s.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>QBasic is actually an interpreter and an IDE together.  When you enter code, the QBasic editor automatically formats it for things like whitespace and capitalization.  The <a href="http://qb64.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer">QB64 emulator</a>, which I'm using to test my programs, gives the option of turning auto-formatting off, allowing a few nice golfing shortcuts in an otherwise fairly verbose language.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>This is a valid QBasic program--but only because QBasic allows line numbers.  The above is therefore an empty statement (on line number 1), which does nothing.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>?a
</code></pre>

<p>Lots of stuff going on here:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>?</code> is a shortcut for <code>PRINT</code>.</li>
<li><code>a</code> is a variable. Since it doesn't have a type suffix and hasn't been declared with <code>DIM</code>, it is numeric; so it is auto-initialized to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Thus, this program is basically equivalent to <code>PRINT 0</code>. But because QBasic is optimized (?) for outputting numeric data in tables, what it actually prints is <code> 0 </code>. (The leading space is so <code>1</code> and <code>-1</code> will line up properly, and I suspect the trailing space is so that printing multiple numbers in a row won't result in something like <code>-1-2-3</code>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>CLS
</code></pre>

<p>QBasic doesn't use an output stream like C-based languages; instead, it uses a cursor to write stuff to a window (see snippet 13 for more on that). The DOS implementation doesn't clear the window between runs, so it can start to get cluttered after a while:</p>

<pre><code> 0 
 0 
 0 
</code></pre>

<p>--which is why most QBasic programs have the CLear Screen command somewhere near the beginning.</p>

<p>(The QB64 emulator starts over with a blank screen each time you run your program, which I find just a little disappointing.)</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>BEEP
</code></pre>

<p>Does <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/9004/play-a-sound-any-sound/11560#11560">just what you think it does</a>.</p>

<p>What I like about QBasic is that it has fun commands like this <em>built into the syntax</em>, whereas other languages usually require external libraries or weird workarounds. In Python, for example, the quickest way to get a beep is the extremely cryptic <code>print("\a")</code>; but that doesn't even work in all environments (in particular, the IDLE shell that comes with Python prints a bullet character instead).</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>?2^42
</code></pre>

<p><code>^</code> is exponentiation, of course. (Don't know what possessed C and its derivatives to use it for bitwise xor.)</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this looks like integer math, we don't get an overflow. The default numeric type in QBasic is actually <code>SINGLE</code>, which is a floating-point number that shows (up to) seven significant digits. If the fractional part is zero, it will display as an integer: for example, <code>PRINT 1.0</code> outputs <code>1</code>. The result above has more than seven significant digits, however; so we get it in scientific notation as <code>4.398047E+12</code>.</p>

<p>Annotating one of the operands with the <code>#</code> suffix would coerce the expression to <code>DOUBLE</code> precision, giving up to fifteen significant digits: <code>?2#^42</code> gives <code>4398046511104</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>?1:RUN
</code></pre>

<p>Our first multi-statement program! <code>:</code> is a statement separator.</p>

<p>The <code>RUN</code> command can be used in a few different ways. If you give it the name of another QBasic source file, it will switch execution to that program. If you give it a line number in the current program, it will restart the program at that line. (This is different from a <code>GOTO</code> because all variables are cleared, as if starting the program from scratch.) And if you don't specify an argument, it will restart the program from the top. The code above prints <code>1</code> infinitely.</p>

<p>If you don't want the <code>1</code>s on their own lines, you could use <code>?1;:RUN</code>--the semicolon suppresses the newline when printing. But that will actually give you <code> 1  1  1 ...</code> (see the length-2 snippet for why). To fill the screen with <code>1</code>s, you'd need to use a string: <code>?"1";:RUN</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>INPUT x
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>INPUT</code> statement by default displays a <code>?</code> prompt and waits for the user to enter a value. Lacking a type suffix, <code>x</code> is a single-precision numeric variable, so anything like <code>3.14</code> or <code>-42</code> is valid input. What happens if you try to enter something that's not a number?</p>

<pre><code>? Jabberwocky
Redo from start
? 
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit cryptic, and it can royally mess up the alignment if your program is using some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">text-based user interface</a>, but at least the program doesn't <a href="http://ideone.com/KGsZTK" rel="nofollow noreferrer">crash</a>, <a href="http://ideone.com/2p9dRT" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interpret the input as 0</a>, or anything weird like that. ;^)</p>

<p><sub>Note: QB64 doesn't even let you type invalid characters when an INPUT statement asks for a number.</sub></p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>PLAY"CF"
</code></pre>

<p>Music is yet another feature awesomely built in to QBasic. This code plays two quarter notes (middle C and middle F). A <code>PLAY</code> string has ways of changing the octave, playing sharps and flats, changing the duration of notes, and so much more!</p>

<h3>Length 9</h3>

<pre><code>SCREEN 12
</code></pre>

<p>Different <code>SCREEN</code> modes in QBasic allow for different graphical capabilities: various resolutions, color vs. black-and-white, text-only or graphics-capable. Historically, these were included to account for differences among display hardware. The default mode, <code>SCREEN 0</code>, is text-only, so any program with graphics in it has to start with a <code>SCREEN</code> statement. (Pretty pictures later if I get more votes!)</p>

<h3>Length 10</h3>

<pre><code>?4*ATN(1#)
</code></pre>

<p>Would you care for some pi? QBasic has a good number of math functions built in, ArcTaNgent among them. The <code>#</code> type annotation is used here to make the resulting value <code>DOUBLE</code>, so we get more digits: <code>3.141592653589793</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 11</h3>

<pre><code>COLOR 2:?42
</code></pre>

<p>Time to get colorful.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/0ck2w.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/0ck2w.png" alt="Green 42"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<p>In the default <code>SCREEN 0</code>, QBasic offers 16 foreground colors:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/KcEPj.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/KcEPj.png" alt="The 16 colors in QBasic"></a></p>

<p>Each color 8-15 is a lighter version of the corresponding 0-7 color. The darker colors 0-7 are also available as background colors, and adding 16 to a foreground color makes it blink! (See <a href="http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=33506" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this thread</a>, particularly the bottom post, for a great historical explanation.) So, since a <code>COLOR</code> statement affects everything subsequently printed, we can write this:</p>

<p><code>COLOR 25,4</code></p>

<p>and see this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/V8G9J.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/V8G9J.gif" alt="Blinking &quot;Press any key&quot;"></a></p>

<p>Trippy.</p>

<h3>Length 12</h3>

<pre><code>DRAW"F3U7R9"
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>DRAW</code> command takes a string of codes and draws stuff on the screen. As a graphics command, it cannot be used in the default screen mode, so you'll need to combine this snippet with snippet 9 in order to run it. This example goes 3 pixels diagonally down and right, 7 pixels up, and 9 pixels right, for a tiny square root symbol:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/XxAXR.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/XxAXR.png" alt="QBasic DRAW command--square root symbol"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<h3>Length 13</h3>

<pre><code>LOCATE 7,8:?9
</code></pre>

<p>Recall (from snippet 3) that QBasic outputs text to a window, not an output stream. The <code>LOCATE</code> command allows you to set the cursor location for output. So if you want to display something halfway down the screen, you don't need to print a bunch of newlines first--just <code>LOCATE</code> to the right row and column.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/uIZXO.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/uIZXO.png" alt="Using LOCATE command"></a></p>

<p>Importantly, this doesn't affect any other text on the screen (except when directly overwriting it), which makes QBasic very straightforward for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">textual user interfaces</a>--or <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/49082/16766">dungeon games</a>. Most languages would have to use control codes or a library like curses. </p>

<h3>Length 14</h3>

<pre><code>GOTO a
?1
a:?2
</code></pre>

<p>What would QBasic be without <code>GOTO</code>? The much-maligned feature is alive and well here, allowing arbitrary jumps in program flow to defined labels. The above snippet, of course, skips to the third line and outputs <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>A label must come at the beginning of a line. It can be any identifier followed by a colon; or, it can be a BASIC-style line number, sans colon.</p>

<p>While it is true that 1) most uses of <code>GOTO</code> can be replaced by conditionals or looping constructs and 2) those that are too complicated for this treatment are probably a bad idea to begin with, I still like <code>GOTO</code>, for a couple of reasons. First, it's how assembly works under the hood, so learning it first in QBasic is valuable practice. Second, I still think it's more readable (and less redundant) to write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>getNumber:
INPUT x
IF x = 0 THEN PRINT "Enter a nonzero number": GOTO getNumber
PRINT "The inverse is"; 1/x
</code></pre>

<p>than the Python equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>x = float(input())
while x == 0:
    print("Enter a nonzero number")
    x = float(input())
print("The inverse is", 1/x)
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 15</h3>

<pre><code>RANDOMIZE TIMER
</code></pre>

<p>QBasic does (pseudo)random numbers via the <code>RND</code> function, which is normally invoked without arguments and returns a random number in the range <code>[0, 1)</code>. However, you'll get the same sequence on each run of the program unless you seed the PRNG with the <code>RANDOMIZE</code> statement. The usual seed is <code>TIMER</code>, which returns the number of seconds since midnight. This provides a different seed on each run of the program... at least, if you don't run it at exactly the same time each day.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> want the same numbers each run (maybe for testing purposes), you can pass a constant to <code>RANDOMIZE</code>--or just put <code>RANDOMIZE</code> without specifying a seed, in which case you'll be prompted when you run your program:</p>

<pre><code>Random-number seed (-32768 to 32767)? 
</code></pre>

<p>Nobody can say QBasic isn't user-friendly.</p>

<h3>Length 16</h3>

<pre><code>CIRCLE(9,9),8,,2
</code></pre>

<p>Graphics command: combine with snippet 9 to run.</p>

<p>QBasic's drawing commands are interesting because they each have a unique syntax, tailored to make the most sense for the particular command. The syntax for <code>CIRCLE</code> is <code>CIRCLE (x, y), radius[, options]</code>. (If you think that's odd, just wait till we get to see <code>LINE</code> in snippet 18.)</p>

<p>The first option to <code>CIRCLE</code> is <code>color</code>: we could have drawn a green circle with <code>CIRCLE(9,9),8,2</code>. But we've got an extra character to play with, so let's leave the color option blank (defaulting to white) and look at the next option. This happens to be <code>startRadian</code>. A value of <code>2</code> means that instead of a full circle, we get an arc of 2π - 2 radians:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/UNZwb.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/UNZwb.png" alt="Arc of circle"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<p>(Note that this apparently follows the standard quadrants system, despite the fact that QBasic has the origin at the top left with the positive y-axis pointing down.) The remaining <code>CIRCLE</code> options are <code>endRadian</code> and <code>aspect</code>, which allows you to draw ellipses:</p>

<pre><code>CIRCLE(51,26),50,,,,0.5
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 17</h3>

<pre><code>LINE INPUT s$:?s$
</code></pre>

<p>Reads an arbitrary line of text from the user and echoes it back.</p>

<p>What's important here is the word "arbitrary." The reason for the existence of <code>LINE INPUT</code> is that the regular <code>INPUT</code> command can't read commas. It treats them as field separators, so you can get two strings in one go by doing <code>INPUT a$, b$</code>. (Also useful for reading comma-separated data from a file.) But what if your input contains commas? Well, you can wrap it in double quotes and it'll treat the comma as part of the string. But what if your input also contains double quotes? That's when you need <code>LINE INPUT</code>, which simply reads everything until you hit enter.</p>

<h3>Length 18</h3>

<pre><code>LINE(1,1)-(9,9),,B
</code></pre>

<p>Graphics command: combine with snippet 9 to run. Draws a line from <code>(1,1)</code> to <code>(9,9)</code>, right? Well... not exactly.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/BsQf7.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/BsQf7.png" alt="It&#39;s a box!"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<p>This <em>would</em> create a diagonal line, except that we've also specified the <code>B</code> option for "box." So instead of a line, we get a rectangle. There's also <code>BF</code> for "box, filled." (As in snippet 16, the empty space between commas is for the unused color argument.)</p>

<p>I'm actually a fan of this unusual syntax, whenever it makes sense for the given command. I find that it's a mnemonic aid. Contrast the above with a function that takes a gajillion* positional arguments--you can never remember which one is which--or half a gajillion keyword arguments--you 1) have to remember the names of the keywords and 2) can end up with a pretty long line of code if you use multiple arguments. (I know the counterarguments; I'm just saying that this is something I enjoy about QBasic.)</p>

<p><sup>* Slight hyperbole.</sup></p>

<h3>Length 19</h3>

<pre><code>?0:PAINT(10,4),9,15
</code></pre>

<p>Graphics command: combine with snippet 9 to run.</p>

<p><code>PAINT</code> takes a starting point, a fill color, and a border color. It does a flood fill until it hits border-colored pixels or the edge of the screen. It's typically used to fill circles, rectangles, and other graphics figures. But hey, printed text is just pixels on the screen too:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/Zq6C9.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/Zq6C9.png" alt="0 donut filled with blue(berry) jelly"></a> <sup><em>(Shown 2x actual size)</em></sup></p>

<h3>Length 20</h3>

<pre><code>?ASC(INPUT$(1));
RUN
</code></pre>

<p><code>INPUT</code> and <code>LINE INPUT</code> aren't the only ways to get input in QBasic. The <code>INPUT$(n)</code> function reads <em>n</em> keypresses and returns them as a string. (It can also be used to read from a file or a serial port.) <code>INPUT$</code> does not display a prompt or echo the characters to the screen as they are typed. It therefore has a myriad of uses, from password entry to the famous "Press any key to continue."</p>

<p>The above program waits until the user presses a key, prints the ASCII code of that character, and loops infinitely using <code>RUN</code> (see snippet 6). Entering <code>ABC123&lt;esc&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;bksp&gt;</code> will result in output of</p>

<p>This is an example on how to create an array, don't forget to add <code>;</code> at the end of the statement. The array will have empty length, you can check it using <code>sizeof</code> function. To append at the end of that array, you might use <code>[]=</code> operator, for example: <code>$a[] = 12</code>, this would append a number <code>12</code> to that array, that similar as typing <code>array(12)</code> at initialization.</p>

<p><em>If you're having difficulty understanding any of these concepts (or, more likely, if I'm explaining them poorly), please feel free to try it yourself on <a href="http://tiny.cc/detour" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the online interpreter</a> which gives a nice visualization of the data moving around. There is also a <a href="http://detour.tryitonline.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TIO site</a> but it doesn't have a cell visualization tool</em></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Detour is a 2D language I made. While most 2D languages revolve around directing the instruction pointer (think <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish" rel="nofollow noreferrer">>&lt;></a>, <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge" rel="nofollow noreferrer">befunge</a>), this one focuses on redirection of <em>data/objects</em>. Each character in the program translates to a <em>cell</em>. Each cell will either simply pass on its contents (NOP), modify its contents and pass it on (operations such as addition), or redirect its contents (e.g. pointing its contents downward). More on this later.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Detour got its name from the "control flow" in the language. I often find myself constructing complex paths to make data travel around the existing data flow, hence "Detour". This is the purest form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">spaghetti code</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>:
</code></pre>

<p><code>:</code> specifies where input is taken. At the start of the program, all input arguments are pushed to the <code>:</code> cell, and then start moving rightward. If no <code>:</code> cell is found, one is inserted by default somewhere (usually at the top or middle).</p>

<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>+.
</code></pre>

<p>This is a program that adds two numbers and outputs the result. The <code>.</code> outputs its contents; that's pretty simple. The more complex part would be <code>+</code>. <code>+</code> is a binary operator which, as you would expect, adds two numbers. The way it adds them, however, is a little weird. In Detour, an operator that takes multiple operands will wait for all its operands to be in the cell before performing the operation. </p>

<p>So let's say a <code>3</code> is pushed into a <code>+</code> cell. That <code>3</code> will stay in that cell until a second number is also pushed into the cell. After our program does its thing, eventually a <code>4</code> finds its way into the same <code>+</code> cell. Now, it has two operands, and will happily add them together and push the result (<code>7</code>) into the next cell. </p>

<p>In this case, the next cell is <code>.</code>. Once the two input arguments get onto the <code>+</code> cell, their result is pushed to <code>.</code>, which outputs the result and exits the program.</p>

<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>$&lt;&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now it's starting to get interesting. <code>&lt;</code> is the decrement operator, so it takes <code>n</code> and pushes <code>n-1</code> to the next cell. <code>$</code> is the duplicate operator, it clones its contents, pushing one to the next cell, while the other skips the immediate cell. The first clone usually will then also hit the second cell.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>$&lt;&lt;
4

$&lt;&lt;
 44

$&lt;&lt;
  33

$&lt;&lt;
   23
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>$&lt;&lt;</code> yields <code>n-2, n-1</code>. I use this in my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/85/fibonacci-function-or-sequence/69796#69796">fibonacci sequence answer</a></p>

<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[&lt;,]
</code></pre>

<p>Now it starts to get interesting. <code>[]</code> denotes a loop; that is to say, data will pass through it until it is negative or zero. The body of the loop, <code>&lt;,</code> does two things: 1) decrement the number; 2) output it. For example, <code>4[&lt;,]</code> will output <code>3210</code></p>

<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[$&lt;&lt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Now we get to start combining previous snippets (I know, a bit cheaty, but it's late and I'm tired). Remember how in the length 3 snippet we discussed how <code>n$&lt;&lt;</code> yields <code>(n-2, n-1)</code>? Now imagine if we repeatedly run that process over all generated <code>n</code> until they are all ≤ 0? We get the fibonacci sequence! </p>

<p><em>Warning: the produced results  will be negative. Take this into account before <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/70652/reverse-engineer-the-n-bonacci-sequences#comment172902_70652">using this sequence for something that may pertain to black holes</a></em></p>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>g&gt;d$G+
</code></pre>

<p>This calculates, given <code>n</code>, <code>n + (n + 1) / 2</code>. While this is not very useful, it demonstrates an important concept: registers. <code>g</code> stores a value in the register, while <code>G</code> retrieves it. What happens is the number gets stored in <code>g</code>. Then it walks through, getting incremented (<code>&gt;</code>), cut in half (<code>d</code>), then duplicated (<code>$</code>). The new value (<code>(n+1)/2</code>) gets added to the value stored in <code>g</code> (<code>n</code>). This yields <code>n + (n+1)/2</code>. Here we start getting into the complicated stuff that's hard to explain with words, feel free to <a href="https://rawgit.com/cyoce/detour/master/interp.html?hex=Omc+ZCRHKy4K" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it in the interpreter</a>.</p>

<p><em>Registers are used in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/85/fibonacci-function-or-sequence/69796#69796">my fibonacci sequence answer</a> (the 30-byte solution) to store the value of <code>sqrt(5)</code>.</em></p>

<h2>Length 7 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;Q.
;d&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is again kind of nonsensical, but demonstrates two key components of Detour.</p>

<ol>
<li>Control flow (<code>Q</code>)</li>
<li>Recursion (<code>;</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>First off, Control Flow.
<br>
As mentioned in the intro, control flow in Detour is pretty nonstandard. In Detour, control flow cells manipulate an object's direction or location rather than its value. We have seen some control flow in the form of <code>$</code> and <code>[]</code>. 
<br>
As in the example, <code>Q</code> <em>conditionally</em> redirects objects: that is, it will move an object depending on the object's value. In <code>Q</code>'s case, it will push the object down (put keep it pointed in the same direction) if it is positive, and will push it forward otherwise.</p>

<p>Recursion (<code>;</code>) is another type of control flow. <code>;</code> will move an object to the start of the program (where the input came through, or more concisely, the location of the <code>:</code> cell). </p>

<p>Combining these two things, we can see what the snippet does</p>

<ul>
<li>take input <code>n</code></li>
<li>decrement it</li>
<li>If <code>n &gt;= 0</code>, push it down

<ul>
<li>halve it, then decrement it and move it back to the start (lines wrap around in Detour making <code>;&gt;d</code> equivalent to <code> &gt;d;</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Else, push it forward

<ul>
<li>output it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This can be translated to the following Python program:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def f(n):
  n -= 1      # &lt;
  if n &lt;= 0:  # Q
    print(n)    # .
  else:       # Q
    n /= 2      # d
    n -= 1      # &lt;
    f(n)        # ;

f(input())
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 9 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;Q&gt;S.
;$&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a recursive fibonacci definition. <code>S</code> sums up all items pushed to it. The bottom uses the fact that objects can wrap around the edges, so <code>;$&lt;</code> is identical to <code>$&lt;;</code> with a leading space.</p>

<h2>Factoid:</h2>

<p>Woefully is a 2d language with no traditional conditionals (ooh, that rhyme). The closest thing it has to conditionals is the boolean/not_zero command, which pushes <code>int(stack_A.pop()!=0)</code>. It's also pretty weird in other ways.</p>

<p>It isn't really possible to even write a program in less than 7 characters, unless you count printing the "error" message as a program, or immediately halting as a program, so perhaps I'll multiply the votes by 4 to get the amount of bytes I can have, if that's allowable (context: it takes 266 bytes to write a truth machine, unless it could be golfed more,)</p>

<h2>1*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>boom
</code></pre>

<p>this program technically doesn't error, but just prints "confuse :(", the "error" message of the language, which counts as regular output as it goes to STDOUT, not STDERR. This program doesn't conform to the program composition requirements (needs to have no characters that aren't pipes, spaces and newlines, needs to have at least one space, needs to have no spaces at the start and end of lines), and so automatically prints the message "confuse :("</p>

<p>BTW it is going to be a while before anything really interesting, like even a program that just takes input, or pushes a number, so you might want to look at my <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/92377/55896">truth machine</a> to see what Woefully looks like</p>

<h2>2*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>| |
|| |
</code></pre>

<p>Ooh, we have the first program that doesn't just print "confuse :(" and die. This program does... nothing. It is in an infinite loop of nops</p>

<h3>Why it nops forever</h3>

<p>diagram!</p>

<pre><code>v
|\|
||\|
  X
</code></pre>

<p>The char pointer, the first of two pointers, starts at the character pointed to by v. The instruction pointer will find the first space after this char, and execute the path of spaces it is a part of. The <code>\</code> shows the path. the instruction pointer goes down this path, but does nothing, since lines that are two-long are nops. Once it finishes the path, (symbolised by the X), the instruction pointer returns to the char pointer, which has not moved, and executes it again, forever.</p>

<h2>3*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>| |
| |
| ||
</code></pre>

<p>This program terminates in an error (not confuse, but an actual error), but why?</p>

<p>three down executes the A to B command, popping the top of the A stack, and pushing it to the B stack. (there are two stacks). However, the program does not immediately fail, because the stacks start with values already on them: one zero each, it runs once normally, then fails the next iteration of the loop.</p>

<h2>4*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>||| |
|| ||
| ||
</code></pre>

<p>This program pushes zero to stack A infinitely. this is because all diagonally down left commands push the length of the command, minus three. minus three because a command that is two long is a nop, so the shortest push command is three long, and the smallest push-able value is zero.</p>

<h2>5*4 bytes</h2>

<pre><code>| || |
||| ||
|| |||
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't really have anything interesting (apart from some more erroring commands) to show this time, but I realised none of the snippets halt, though some error, so this snippet just halts, without doing anything (including the push at the right)</p>

<h3>diagram!</h3>

<pre><code>v       char pointer starts pointing here
|X||a|   X has the first space after that character, so it's path is executed
|||a|| X halts the program

<p>Tellurium is an esoteric, tape-based programming language written by me in Python. It's mainly intended for use in code-golf challenges, but it pretty much failed at that task.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>^
</code></pre>

<p><code>^</code> is the output/print command. It outputs whatever is in the selected cell, which, in the above snippet, is 0. (0 is the default value)</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>i^
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simple cat program (a program that copies its input to its output). <code>i</code> takes input and puts it in the selected cell. As you probably remember, <code>^</code> outputs whatever is in the selected cell.</p>

<p>(I promise that there will be more interesting snippets later on. There's not much you can do with two commands)</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>I§^
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet calculates the factorial of the input and displays it.</p>

<p><code>I</code> gets input and converts it to an integer. <code>§</code> calculates the factorial, and stores the result in the selected cell.</p>

<p>There are numerous other math-related one character builtins, for example:</p>

<p><code>I½^</code> calculates the exponent of the input</p>

<p><code>Iq^</code> calculates the square root of the input</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>{p}f
</code></pre>

<p>This is an anonymous function that does... nothing.</p>

<p>In Tellurium, you can create an anonymous function by using the syntax <code>{code}f</code>. The function can then be called using the command <code>ä</code>.</p>

<p><code>p</code> is a placeholder command, the equivalent to the Python statement <code>pass</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>[I|^;
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet uses a loop to output <code>0</code> <em>n</em> times. The syntax for a loop in Tellurium is <code>[times|code;</code>. If <code>I</code> is in the <code>times</code> section, it will run the code <em>input</em> times.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>µHi!~^
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, something more interesting. This snippet outputs <code>Hi!</code>. The syntax for inserting text into the selected cell is a bit strange: <code>µ(text)~</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>¤h|Hey]
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet showcases variables. Again, the syntax is a bit strange: <code>¤(name)|(value)]</code>. In this case, it stores "Hey" in the variable <code>h</code>.</p>

<p>To display that variable, use <code>;h.^</code>.</p>

<div id="pu117" class="pu"><h1>Clojure</h1>

<p>Clojure is a variant of Lisp which runs on the Java virtual machine and the .Net virtual machine. A cross-compiler is also available which will turn Clojure code into JavaScript, and thus Clojure code can be run on just about any computer. Clojure can be written in a functional style which is what got me interested in it.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 Snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>;</code> - comments begin with a semi-colon and run until the end-of-line. This is also a valid (if not particularly interesting :-) one-character program.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 Snippet</strong></p>

<p>One of the strengths of any Lisp-style language is its built-in support for collections. In Clojure there are three main collection types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lists, which are groups of values surrounded by parentheses - <code>()</code></li>
<li>Vectors, which are groups of values surrounded by square braces - <code>[]</code></li>
<li>Maps, which are pairs of values surrounded by curly braces - <code>{}</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Lists are both a data structure and the basis for all programming because all programs in Clojure consist of Lists of function names and arguments (Lisp was originally an acronym which stood for List Processor). An empty List (<code>()</code>), Vector (<code>[]</code>), or Map (<code>{}</code>) is also a valid (if uninteresting) program.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 Snippet</strong></p>

<p>Invoking a function in Clojure is done by putting the function name first in a list (also known as a sequence), followed by its arguments. For example, if we have a function named <code>a</code> then we would invoke it as <code>(a)</code>, assuming it takes no arguments.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 Snippet</strong></p>

<p>@user100464's comment got me thinking about quoted forms. A quoted form is introduced with a back-quote character, so</p>

<pre><code>`(a)
</code></pre>

<p>is a quoted form which will invoke the function <code>a</code> when the quoted form is executed. (This can also be written as <code>(quote (a))</code>). According to <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/colin-jones/2012/05/22/quoting-without-confusion.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this blog posting by Colin Jones</a>, quoting is "one of the most Lispy of the Lisp features". Colin's blog post goes into a good amount of detail about using quoting in Clojure macro definitions (which IMO is a topic worthy of entire books) - however, let's simply say that you can evaluate a quoted form using the (you guessed it) <code>eval</code> function. So let's say we create a simple function <code>a</code> with</p>

<pre><code>(defn a [] (println "a invoked"))
</code></pre>

<p>which we can invoke from the REPL with the "normal" unquoted form</p>

<pre><code>(a)
</code></pre>

<p>which prints</p>

<pre><code>a invoked
</code></pre>

<p>Cool. Now let's create a quoted form which will execute our function <code>a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(def quota `(a))
</code></pre>

<p>We can then invoke it with</p>

<pre><code>(eval quota)
</code></pre>

<p>which prints</p>

<pre><code>a invoked
</code></pre>

<p>So at its most basic level quoting allows us to create a form to invoke a function, then keep that form hanging around uninvoked until we want to invoke it. For those familiar with C a quoted form is a bit like a function pointer, allowing you to save up the ability to invoke a function anonymously until you're ready to do so. (Lispers - please don't start in on me. Yes, I know what I just said is hideously inaccurate and nearly-but-not-quite completely wrong. However, it's "lies to children" (ref. Terry Pratchett et al in his "Science of Discworld" series). If you think explaining nuclear physics to wizards is easy, <em>you</em> try it! :-) ((Rant on) And C'ers - please don't take offense. I wrote C et se derivees on a daily basis for over 10 years, Back In The Day. I don't anymore. Why? Simple - Moore's Law won. Due to CPU speed increases execution time has become a DRM issue - i.e. whether a compiled-and-optimized C program takes 0.0001 seconds to execute vs. an ugly, slow interpreted language version of the same program taking 0.1 seconds to execute Doesn't Really Matter - the user pushes Enter and the answer comes out before their finger lifts off the key. My day job is writing boring back-office code for a major retailer using Oracle's PL/SQL language (think "Ada with embedded SQL"). The byte-code interpreter is pretty good - but execution time is absolutely dominated by SQL execution time Every Single Time, so it's not that the PL/SQL byte-code interpreter is so great, it's that the CPU is sufficiently fast and the database is so much the elephant in the room that faster execution of non-database code Doesn't Really Matter.

<p>Ooooh! Tail recursion! Oooooh!</p>

<p>OK, now that we've gotten over that - WHAT THE HECK IS TAIL RECURSION?!?!? And I don't actually HAVE a tail - can I still use it?!?</p>

<p>Yes - yes, you can.</p>

<p>Tail recursion is a nice way of saying "Branching back to the start of the function (or some other point) instead of making a time-and-memory-consuming recursive function call". Recursive function calls do nasty things like consuming stack space, which is in limited supply and when it's gone, so's your program.</p>

<p>And oh-by-the-way, in Clojure you <em>have</em> to use tail recursion if you want to do any kind of looping. It's just kind of what you do.</p>

<p>Tail recursion in Clojure is done by using the <code>recur</code> form, which takes a variable number of values (see the Length 11 Snippet below for more information), binds those values to the bindings at the recursion point (say <em>what</em>?!?), and then jumps back to the recursion point. And oh-by-the-way - <code>(recur)</code> must be in tail position. (HUH?!?!?).</p>

<p>OK, let's explain.</p>

<p>First, what's a recursion point? A recursion point is a point in the program you can recurse back to. (Oh, thanks...). No, seriously - there are only two recursion points in Clojure - either the beginning of a function (in other words a <code>(defn...</code> or <code>(fn...</code> form) or the top of a loop (i.e. the <code>(loop...</code> form). </p>

<p>So, why all this agony to do looping? Why not something like <code>(for (= i 0) (&lt;= i 10) (+ i 1))</code>? Recall if you will that, in general, "variables" in Clojure DON'T CHANGE - in other words, variables are really constants. (Clojure cognoscenti: "lies to children", OK?). Thus, you don't (usually) assign a new value to a "variable", and thus you can't do the usual "loop" thing where you change the value of the loop control variable.</p>

<p>So what you do in Clojure is, you re-bind the function-or-loop parameters to new values, then re-run the function-or-loop against those new values. Hopefully, since you're doing recursion (and nobody likes an infinite recurser :-) you've got something in the body of your recursive code which forces the recursion to terminate. If not - well, then you can use your CPU to grill hot dogs... :-)</p>

<p>And, oh yeah - "tail position". <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7813497/clojure-what-exactly-is-tail-position-for-recur">There's a really good explanation of it here</a>, but suffice to say that an expression is in tail position if it would be returned from the form - i.e. it's not followed by any other form executions.</p>

<p>Now, in some Lisps tail recursion is performed by executing a form which calls the function the code is currently in. The compiler recognizes this and turns the call into a tail-recursive branch back to the beginning of the function if it can - so you'd see something like</p>

<pre><code>(defn some-func [n]
  (if (&lt; n 10)
    (do                       ; then case
      (printf "loop continues %d\n" n)
      (some-func (inc n)))
    (printf "loop done\n")))  ; else case
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>(some-func (inc n))</code> would be a tail-recursive invocation of <code>some-func</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that if the recursive form invocation isn't truly in tail position it will still be compiled properly by the compiler (it's valid code, after all) - but it will become a stack-consuming function call, which can cause your program to blow up unexpectedly, and it can be very difficult to figure out what's gone wrong.</p>

<p>Clojure's solution is to use the special <code>recur</code> form to indicate that a tail-recursive loop is desired. The compiler checks to ensure that the <code>recur</code> form is in tail position - i.e. that there are no form invocations which follow it in the loop - and then generates to code to re-bind arguments and branch back to the recursion point. In this manner you're guaranteed to get a truly tail-recursive branch or else you get a compiler error. Thus, in Clojure <code>some-func</code> would be:</p>

<pre><code>(defn some-func [n]
  (if (&lt; n 10)
    (do                       ; then case
      (printf "loop continues %d\n" n)
      (recur (inc n)))
    (printf "loop done\n")))  ; else case
</code></pre>

<p>For other examples of the use of <code>(recur)</code> look a bit further down the page to the Length 11 Snippet.</p>

<pre><code>(sum 1 2 3)
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things I like about Clojure is its handling of variable numbers of parameters to a function. Let's say that you want to write a function named <code>sum</code> to sum up a bunch of numbers (which is a completely <em>stupid</em> thing to do in Clojure, as it already has a very nice function called <code>+</code> which does exactly that - so <code>(+ 1 2)</code> returns 3, <code>(+ 1 2 3 4)</code> returns 10, and so on - but we'll do it anyways, not because we're stupid, but because we're writing a snippet to explain a concept :-). Well, golly, you say, if I want to enter <code>(sum 1 2)</code>, that's a function which takes two arguments; but if I want to add up three arguments that would be <code>(sum 1 2 3)</code>, which would be a different function; and then <code>(sum 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 987654321)</code> would be Yet Another Function, etc, ad nauseum. It sure would be nice if there was a way to let a function just take in all the arguments someone wanted to pass, without having to explicitly name them every time. And, of course, there is... :-)</p>

<p>In Clojure you specify a function which takes a variable number of parameters thusly:</p>

<pre><code>(defn a-func [arg1 arg2 &amp; more-args] ... )
</code></pre>

<p>This function requires two arguments <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code>, and accepts an undefined number of additional arguments which are put into a vector and bound to the argument <code>more-args</code>. So let's see how we'd take advantage of this to write a <code>sum</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>(defn sum [n &amp; more-n]
  (loop [ tot     0
          num     n
          rest-n  more-n ]
  (if (&gt; (count rest-n) 0)
    (recur (+ tot num) (first rest-n) (rest rest-n))
    (+ tot num))))
</code></pre>

<p>Here we define a function <code>sum</code> which takes <em>at least</em> one argument, named <code>n</code>, and optionally takes a bunch of other arguments which will be lumped together into <code>more-n</code>. Inside the function we create a loop (which is, if you recall, a recursion point) which defines several bindings: <code>tot</code> is the summed total of all the arguments, which will be returned later; 'num', which is the number we're working with right now; and <code>rest-n</code> which is the rest of our numbers.</p>

<p>Note that a slightly more Lisp-y way to define our <code>sum</code> function is to use a "worker" function to do all the actual summation work instead of a loop:</p>

<pre><code>(defn sum-all [tot n more-n]
  (if (&gt; (count more-n) 0)
    (recur (+ tot n) (first more-n) (rest more-n))
    (+ tot n)))

(defn sum [n &amp; more-n]
  (sum-all 0 n more-n))
</code></pre>

<p>This version turns the <code>loop</code> of the first version into a separate function, which then recursively re-invokes itself.</p>

<p>So now you know a bit about handling variable numbers of arguments in Clojure.</p>

<div id="pu118" class="pu"><h1>dc</h1>

<p>Almost nine months later -- I can't believe <strong>dc</strong> is not on the list!</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>dc (<strong>d</strong>esktop <strong>c</strong>alculator) is a Unix utility older than the C programming language, and also the hardest programming language to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">google</a>. Luckily it's probably preinstalled on your Linux, Unix or Mac box, and available for Cygwin too!</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>dc is a stack oriented language. <code>1</code> is an instruction that pushes the number 1 one the stack so that we can use it for other instructions.</p>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>?f
</code></pre>

<p>These <em>two</em> characters is a whole dc program that actually does <em>three</em> things! It takes a line of input, evaluates the input as dc code, and prints the contents of the stack afterwards. You can feed it with the next snippet that I will post if I get another vote :)</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>zzp
</code></pre>

<p><code>z</code> pushes the current stack depth. Initially the stack is empty, so <code>0</code> is pushed on the stack. The stack is then 1 deep, so the next <code>z</code> pushes <code>1</code>. <code>p</code> prints the top of the stack, which at this point is <code>1</code> (although the stack depth is now 2 :D). </p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>1A0F
</code></pre>

<p>dc supports number input to be in any base from 2 to 16, so the characters <code>0123456789ABCDEF</code> all work as digits. Input numbers are <em>not</em> limited to only digits found in the current radix, but they still respect the positions of that base. This means that in base 10 (which is the default), the given snippet evaluates to
 <code>1*10^3 + A*10^2 + 0*10^1 + F*10^0</code> = <code>2015</code> :)</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>O[P]x
</code></pre>

<p>A convoluted way of printing a newline! <code>O</code> pushes the current <em>output</em> radix (which defaults to 10 and is independent of the input radix). <code>[]</code> defines a <em>macro</em> and pushes it. <code>x</code> pops the macro and executes it. <code>P</code> pops and prints a value as a byte stream.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>[dx]dx
</code></pre>

<p>Duplicate and execute, duplicate and execute, rinse and repeat. One copy of the macro is always left on the stack, so this loops forever. On some systems or implementations it may crash.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>[]sf7&gt;f
</code></pre>

<p>This is sort of an if-statement: It will execute the empty <code>[</code>macro<code>]</code>, which is first <code>s</code>tored in register <code>f</code>, if the top of the stack is <em>less</em> than 7. Intuitive, huh? Just wait for an if-else! I will need way more characters for that though ;)</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>3812649P
</code></pre>

<p>Prints a smiling face <code>:-)</code> Another example of the <code>P</code> command. 3812649 is the character points of the smiley string shifted to their correct position in base 256 and added together. Very useful technique for creating quines and quine-like programs.</p>

<h3>Length 9</h3>

<pre><code>[9&lt;L]dsLx
</code></pre>

<p>This is kinda the standard template for a loop -- <code>9</code> can be replaced with any code, and you can use other comparisons than <code>&lt;</code>. As the snippet stands now though, it is perhaps not the most useful thing in the world:</p>

<p>The comparison consumes one element in addition to the 9 that is pushed every time, so the snippet will pop each element down to, and including, the first element which is less than or equal to 9. If it were to empty the stack, the last comparison would fail with a warning, and leave the 9 on the stack.</p>

<h3>Length 10</h3>

<pre><code>6581840dnP
</code></pre>

<p>If I had actually counted how few characters it takes beforehand, I guess I wouldn't have ruined the surprise just two snippets ago, but yeah... this is a quine.<br>
<sub><sup>(That means that the program prints out its own source code)</sup></sub></p>

<h3>Length 11</h3>

<p>I just came up with this for the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/84327/4372">dc golfing tips</a> post, and I'm quite excited because I'm absolutely sure that this is the shortest possible way to write an <strong>if-else-statement</strong>!</p>

<p>Suppose you want to do <em>if top-of-stack == <code>(THAT)</code> then <code>(THEN)</code> else <code>(ELSE)</code></em> </p>

<pre><code>[[(THEN)2Q]sI(THAT)=I(ELSE)]x
</code></pre>

<p>Uses the <code>I</code> register. The placeholders <em>(THAT)</em>, <em>(THEN)</em> and <em>(ELSE)</em> isn't part of the byte count, and <code>=</code> can of course be exchanged with any of  <code>&gt;</code>, <code>!&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>!&lt;</code>, <code>!=</code>.</p>

<p>This pushes the string <code>"a"</code> to the stack. Pretty self-explanatory. Note that single quotes <code>'</code> cannot be used for this purpose.</p>

<p><code>tran</code> is an incredibly useful built-in I just implemented. This operator is used to define a stack <code>tran</code>sformation. It takes two arrays describing the old and new state of the stack. The second array should be a shuffled version of the first, and the stack will be modified accordingly.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>10 =x

<p>This is the syntax for setting variable <code>x</code>. Note that the <code>=</code> sign has to be <em>touching</em> the identifier; <code>10 = x</code> would do something different.</p>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&amp;print
</code></pre>

<p>Now we get into the interesting stuff. <code>print</code> is a function that pops something from the stack and outputs it. <code>&amp;</code> is a prefix that makes its function peek from the stack instead of popping it. This means that the top of the stack will be outputted, but still left on the stack.</p>

<h2>Length 7 Snippet</h2>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>{10} if
</code></pre>

<p>This showcases two things - blocks and if-statements. A block holds a piece of code. The block <code>{10}</code> is a block that pushes <code>10</code> to the stack. The <code>if</code> command pops a value from the stack, and if it is truthy, executes the given block. In this case, it would push <code>10</code> to the stack.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
:: [0]

&gt;&gt;&gt; {10} if

<h1>Length 8 Snippet</h1>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>{3 2 ^-}
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates another modifier, related to <code>&amp;</code>. Without the <code>^</code>, the block <code>{3 2 -}</code> would just push the difference of 3 and 2 (1). However, the <code>^</code> in front of <code>-</code> makes it do something special. If the block is called with an <code>&amp;</code>, it will execute <code>&amp;-</code> (peek for operands); if not, it will execute <code>-</code> (pop the operands).</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre class="lang-ruby prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {3 2 ^-} =f

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>!
</code></pre>

<p>OK, let me explain a little about PyCal. PyCal has two "variables". One variable's value can be set by the user. The other variable's value comes from the values that some commands return. For example, the <code>F</code> returns the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number.</p>

<p>Anyways, the <code>!</code> command outputs the value that is in the user-set variable. By default, it's 0, so the above snippet outputs 0.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>IP
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet outputs the first <em>n</em> prime numbers as a list.</p>

<p>Let me explain what this does:</p>

<p><code>I</code> gets input, and converts it to an integer before storing it in the variable. (From now on, I'll call the variable that the user can change "variable". The other one will be called the result. Read snippet 1 for more info)</p>

<p><code>P</code> takes the variable's value and prints <em>n</em> prime numbers. For example, if the value is 5, it will output the first 5 primes.</p>

<p>So, here's what it will look like if the input is 10:</p>

<p><code>[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>(7)
</code></pre>

<p>Like the length 10 snippet originally was, this snippet is hidden until somebody finds the easter egg.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/Mego/Seriously/commit/ae71a1bb9a3663713ae479421f1595f246ba02b6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this commit</a>, I introduced an easter egg. If you input the correct 16-byte code as an Actually program, something special will happen!</p>

<p><strong>Length 15 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3,4,5];♀ⁿσ
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://actually.tryitonline.net/#code=WzEsMiwzLDQsNV074pmA4oG_z4M&amp;input=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Try it online!</a></p>

<p>This snippet showcases two new features of Actually:</p>

<ul>
<li>The binary map operator <code>♀</code>: it works like <code>♂</code>, but maps a binary function over the top two stack elements, instead of mapping a unary function over the top element.</li>
<li>The cumulative sum function <code>σ</code>: it takes a list as input, and outputs a list where each element is the sum of the first <code>n</code> elements of the input list.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program outputs the cumulative sums of <code>[x**x for x in [1,2,3,4,5]]</code>. The equivalent Python code would be <code>[1**1,1**1+2**2,1**1+2**2+3**3,1**1+2**2+3**3+4**4,1**1+2**2+3**3+4**4+5**5]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 14 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>1WX╚;;S=YWX♂.X
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet sorts the input list using bogosort and prints out each value in ascending order, separated by newlines.</p>

<p>Cool things in this snippet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implicit input: because there are no input commands (<code>,</code>, <code>○</code>, <code>♀</code>, or <code>╩</code>) in the code, Actually reads all input, parses it, and pushes it before beginning evaluation of the code.</li>
<li>The <code>♂</code> command: it's a shortcut for the map (<code>M</code>) command. It takes the next command (<code>.</code> in the above snippet) and maps it over the list on top of the stack. <code>♂.</code> is functionally equivalent to the following (and 2 bytes shorter!):</li>
</ul>

<p>This snippet shows off a lot of new things. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>:12345678</code>: improved numeric parsing. Rather than needing to be wrapped in <code>:</code>s, numerics merely need to be prefixed with one, and are parsed as the longest string following the <code>:</code> consisting only of characters in <code>0123456789+-.ij</code>.</li>
<li><code>▼</code>: new function (gcd reduce). In this form, it pops two integer values off the top of the stack, and pushes them divided by their gcd.</li>
<li><code>▼</code>: dingbats for characters <code>0x01 - 0x1F</code>. No more typing those pesky invisible or formatting-ruining ASCII control codes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Length 12 snippet</strong></p>

<p>Now that <a href="https://github.com/Mego/Seriously/releases/tag/v2.0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Seriously v2.0 (codename Actually)</a> has been released, it's time to start showing off some nifty features I've added. This snippet shows off nested lists - something that Seriously was lacking because I didn't take the time to write a good parser when I created it. This pushes <code>[[1, 2], [3, 4]]</code> to the stack.</p>

<p>But wait, it's missing the ending bracket! <em>Actually</em>, it isn't. It's implied at EOF. However, the inner list(s) still need their ending brackets, even if the ending brackets are at the end of the source code. This may be changed soon.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11 snippet</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note: this is defunct as of now, due to the Heroku site being disabled. No worries though, a similar easter egg will be added into the actual Python interpreter soon.</strong></p>

<pre><code>↑↑↓↓←→←→ba

<p>A newline at the end makes this 11. This is the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Konami code</a> - "up up down down left right left right b a" (pressing enter to confirm the code, like start in Contra). Entering this in the <a href="https://seriouslylang.herokuapp.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online interpreter</a>, using the arrow keys for the directional inputs, will result in a fun little easter egg - the second easter egg I added.</p>

<p><strong>Length 10 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>??????????
</code></pre>

<p>I added two easter eggs to the Seriously interpreter recently. The first one (from <a href="https://github.com/Mego/Seriously/commit/fb4170c5023975520b346103dec7f10b79070f8d" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this commit</a>) involves doing something special when your code starts with a certain 10 characters. <s>However, I don't want to spoil the secret, so until somebody figures it out, the above code will just be 10 question marks (which is <em>not</em> the secret).</s></p>

<p>Since I've <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/31129955#31129955">revealed the original secret</a> in chat, I might as well reveal it here too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In v1, back before I removed the easter egg, if your code started with <code>^^vv&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;ba</code>, the rest of the code would get <code>exec</code>'d (run as Python code).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>?</code> character will eventually be used as a prefix for some two-byte commands, once the single-byte command table fills up. In addition, once I get it working, <code>??</code> will be a comment delimiter.</p>

<p><em>Update: This secret was causing the interpreter to misbehave, so it has been removed for now. It will come back later, once I can make sure it doesn't break things again.</em></p>

<p>Seriously is <em>seriously</em> powerful and terse when it comes to math. I refuse to apologize for the terrible pun.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>╦ï*╠^φ</code></p>

<p>This snippet showcases the mathematical constant builtins:</p>

<p><code>╦</code> pushes <code>π</code>.</p>

<p><code>ï</code> pushes <code>i</code>, the imaginary unit.</p>

<p><code>*</code> multiplies the top two values.</p>

<p><code>╠</code> pushes <code>e</code>.</p>

<p><code>^</code> pops <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, and pushes <code>pow(a,b)</code>.</p>

<p><code>φ</code> pushes <code>φ</code>, the golden ratio.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>1.61803398875
(-1+1.22464679915e-16j)
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet demonstrates Euler's Identity, one of the most important identities in complex analysis: <code>e^(i*π) = -1</code>. The output value isn't quite <code>-1</code> due to floating-point precision issues and rounding errors, but it's very close. It also outputs <code>φ</code> because I needed a 6th character and I wanted to show off all of the math constants.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>:1+2j</code></p>

<p>Complex number support! I worked a long time on getting this functioning, because Python 2 (the language Seriously is implemented in) does annoying things involving complex numbers.</p>

<p><code>:</code> is the numeric delimiter - everything between it and the next <code>:</code> (or, in this case, EOF - hooray, more implied delimiters) is interpreted as a numeric value and pushed. If it can't be interpreted as a numeric value, <code>0</code> is pushed instead, following the tenet of No Errors.</p>

<p><code>f</code>: pop <code>a</code>: push the index of <code>a</code> in the Fibonacci sequence, or <code>-1</code> if <code>a</code> is not a Fibonacci number.</p>

<p>Pretty simple, right? Wait... There's nothing on the stack! How is this program supposed to work?</p>

<p>In Seriously, one of the fundamental design tenets was that there are no errors. If a command does not get an appropriate value from the stack, it does not throw an error. Instead, it restores the stack and quietly exits. All of these commands are NOPs when the stack is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>,,+</code></p>

<p>This reads in 2 values and adds them (for whatever adding means for the two values). If you pass in two ints, like <code>5</code> and <code>3</code>, the result will be <code>8</code>. If you input two strings like <code>"foo"</code> and <code>"bar"</code>, they are concatenated to form <code>"barfoo"</code> (reversed because they are appended in the order they appear on the stack). If you input two lists, the result will be appending the second to the first: <code>[1,2,3][3,4,5]+ -&gt; [3,4,5,1,2,3]</code>. Adding functions results in their code being appended. Whatever the result, it will be printed to STDOUT.</p>

<p>...wait, why is it printed to STDOUT? There's no <code>.</code> in that snippet! Or is there? When a Seriously program terminates, each value on the stack is popped and printed - there's no need for an explicit <code>.</code> or <code>ü</code> at the end of a program. This is just another feature that saves those ever-precious bytes.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>1W</code></p>

<p>This is an infinite loop. <code>1</code> pushes the integer 1 onto the stack, and <code>W</code> is a loop delimiter - the code inside the loop (which is nothing) executes while the value on top of the stack (which is peeked, not popped) is a truthy value (not <code>0</code>, <code>''</code>, <code>[]</code>, or an empty function). This snippet shows off one of my favorite features in Seriously: like TI-BASIC, closing delimiters are not needed at the end of programs; they are implicitly present at EOF.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong></p>

<p><code>H</code></p>

<p>This prints <code>Hello, World!</code> to STDOUT if the stack is empty.</p>

<p>Seriously got its name from <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/58522/seriously-golfscript-cjam-or-pyth">this challenge</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu125" class="pu"><h1>Tcl</h1>

<p>See also <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44777/25180">this answer</a>.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>In Tcl eval is not evil in most cases. And you can implement your own control structures using eval.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>h
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>tclsh</code> interactively, you need only to write the initial characters of a command, if it is not ambiguous. In this case, there is only one command <code>history</code> beginning with <code>h</code>. So it will print the command history, which is like this:</p>

<pre><code>     1  h
</code></pre>

<p>If you try <code>a</code> instead, it will print something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ambiguous command name "a": after append apply array auto_execok auto_import auto_load auto_load_index auto_qualify
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>

<p>It's the empty string, just like <code>""</code> and <code>{}</code>, but works differently. It executes the commands in the brackets, which are nothing, and substitute the result of the last command, which is empty.</p>

<p>The empty string is also a prefix of every command. So if you type <code>[]</code> directly in <code>tclsh</code>, you can get a list of all available commands while it complains that the empty string is ambiguous.</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>end
</code></pre>

<p>Used in <code>lindex</code>, <code>lrange</code>, <code>string index</code>, <code>string range</code>, etc. While most languages require an extra operation to get the length of a string/list to specify a position at the end of the string, Tcl simply uses <code>end</code>. You can also use <code>end-k</code> where k is an integer, to make it more useful.</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>"\{"
</code></pre>

<p>The string <code>{</code>. You can also use <code>"{"</code>, but that will cause you some trouble. The bodies of control structures in Tcl are parsed as strings, and the closing brace in the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if 1 {puts "{"}
</code></pre>

<p>will match the opening brace in the <code>"{"</code>. So this code is an incomplete statement. You have to add another <code>}</code> to end the if statement.</p>

<p>You can escape the <code>{</code> to get rid of this problem. But of course, if your braces in the string are matched, you don't have to do anything. You can also make braces in different strings matched, which is still valid but may make the code less maintainable.</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>{a b}
</code></pre>

<p>A list. Or just a whitespace-separated string. In case an element contains whitespaces or other special characters, they could be quoted using <code>{}</code> (which cannot contain unbalanced braces) or <code>""</code> (for whitespaces) or escaped using <code>\</code>. <code>""</code> and <code>\</code> can be combined together.</p>

<p>There are many commands working with lists. Basic ones are <code>list</code>, to generate a list from elements, and <code>lindex</code>, to get an element from a list.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<pre><code>\{{}\}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I can't think of a good one with length 6. So here is something random. Apparently Tcl checks only the first character in a word to decide whether it is the beginning of a <code>{}</code> quoted string. So you only have to escape the first <code>{</code> if it is not. Better also escape a matching <code>}</code> to make it matched for the reason described in the length 4 snippet.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>$a(a b)
</code></pre>

<p>Tcl also supports arrays, which are faster for random access than lists. The grammar for accessing an array is <code>$name(index)</code>. So there isn't such a thing as multidimensional array. What would you do if you need it to be multidimensional? Well, one way is to use a list as its index, as shown in this example. Note that the braces in <code>{a b}</code> are quotes of a string and not a part of the list itself, which are not used in the array access grammar. And make sure the list is in the canonical form generated using the <code>list</code> command if you do it this way.</p>

<p>It's not only for array indices. Variable names and even procedure names could also contain spaces or be empty.</p>

<p>After writing this I realized that it isn't as perfect as I thought. Normal variable names cannot both contain any <code>(</code> and end with a <code>)</code>. And array names cannot contain any <code>(</code>. It's also a bit more difficult to access a variable with <code>}</code> in its name, or an array with special characters in its name and also use lists as its index.</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>if 0 [a]
</code></pre>

<p><code>a</code> is executed before the if condition. If the condition is true, the result of <code>a</code> is parsed as commands and executed afterward. But <code>a</code> is always executed. I think I saw this used some times in the old underhanded or popcon questions.</p>

<div id="pu126" class="pu"><h1>Fishing</h1>
<p><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fishing" rel="noreferrer">Fishing</a> is a 2-D programming language created by OriginalOldMan in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>
<p>This language is based off of &quot;fish&quot; that a &quot;fisherman&quot; catches as he walks along a &quot;dock.&quot; Fishing implements a memory tape similar to that of Brainfuck.</p>
<p><em>Note: Since Fishing is very byte-inefficient and that programs with odd byte count are impossible, the length refers to the number of characters used to define the dock. The dock begins after the initial direction walking, direction casting, and casting length of 1 have been set.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 0</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+
</code></pre>
<p>This sets the fisherman to cast his line down by 1 space. The direction the fisherman casts is determined by <code>v</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>^</code>. The length of the line being casted must be a positive integer to work. It is controlled by <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>. By default, the fisherman begins walking east. The commands for the direction the fisherman walks are <code>[</code> to go east, <code>]</code> to go west, <code>|</code> to go north, and <code>_</code> to go south.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 1</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;+CI
</code></pre>
<p>This sets the first cell on the tape equal to the user input. Note that the fisherman is casting to the east.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 2</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CC
  IN
</code></pre>
<p>This is cat. The user input will be printed with a trailing newline.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 3</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCC
  `A`
</code></pre>
<p>This assigns the string <code>A</code> to the first cell on the tape.</p>
<p>When the fisherman catches a tick, the string between the ticks is assigned to the first cell (and can be printed with <code>P</code> or <code>N</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 4</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;+_
  C`
  C3
  C`
  Cn
</code></pre>
<p>Look! Our first example of the fisherman not walking east for the entire program. Like in the snippet with dock length 2, the fisherman will cast west. However, he will also be walking south. Here, the command to walk south must occur after the fisherman receives the information that he is casting to the right by 1, or there will be an error.</p>
<p>In order to have a manipulatable number on the tape, the number must be entered as a string and later be converted into a decimal with <code>n</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 5</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCCCC
  `ab`r
</code></pre>
<p>The string <code>ab</code> is put on the tape, and <code>r</code> is used to reverse it. Note that <code>r</code> cannot reverse a number <em>if the command</em> <code>n</code> <em>has been used on the number</em>. Thus, <code>r</code> will work for the fish <code> `12`r</code> but not for <code> `12`nr</code>.</p>
<p>After the above program, the tape contains the string <code>ba</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 6</strong></p>
<pre><code>    a `N
v+C^CDCC
  `
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we see a couple modifications to the dock itself. The direction of casting is changed from south to north by <code>^</code>. We also see <code>D</code> for the first time. <code>D</code> does not have any function but to keep the fisherman walking on the dock. The fisherman does not cast or change direction. The only function of <code>D</code> is for space.</p>
<p>The above program prints <code>a</code> with a trailing newline.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 7</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCCCCCC
  `4`{`1`
</code></pre>
<p>Fishing works through a series of cells on a tape. It's about time we see implementation of multiple cells. The above code assigns <code>4</code> to the first cell, moves to the right by one cell with <code>{</code> (moving to the left is done with <code>}</code>), and assigns <code>1</code> to the second cell.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 8</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCCCCCCC
  `185`nSN
</code></pre>
<p>We should recognize <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> from before, but <code>S</code> is new. <code>S</code> squares the value in the current cell. The above program will print <code>34225</code>, which is equal to <code>185^2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 9</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCCCCCCCC
  `2015`l{N
</code></pre>
<p><code>l</code> is an interesting fish. It finds the length of the current cell and adds it to the end of the tape. The above code will print the length of the string <code>2015</code>, which is <code>4</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 10</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCC+CCC+CC
`p`ersonally
unliquidated
disjunction`
liver`morium
</code></pre>
<p>One of the cool things about Fishing is that it is really easy to obfuscate messages, such as above or in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/54807/the-programming-language-quiz/55259#55259">this obfuscated <code>Hello, World!</code></a>. The fisherman does not need to catch all of the fish in the program, as seen above. Any characters in the pond that are not caught are simply ignored.</p>
<p>The above program puts <code>eridan</code> on the tape. The <code>er</code> in <code>personally</code>, the <code>ida</code> in <code>unliquidated</code>, and the <code>n</code> in <code>disjunction</code> are used. Another grid that would put <code>eridan</code> on the tape is here.</p>
<pre><code>v+CCC+CCC+CC
..`er.......
......ida...
..........n`
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Dock Length 12</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCCCCCCCCCCC
  `9`n{`8`n}aP
</code></pre>
<p>We can finally have non-arbitrary interactions with other cells on the tape without the value of the second cell depending on the value of the first. We achieve this with <code>a</code>, which adds the value of the cell to the right on the tape to the current cell on the tape. The above will set the value of the first cell to the integer <code>9</code>, set the value of the second cell to the integer <code>8</code>, then replace the first cell with <code>17</code>, and print it.</p>
<p><strong>Dock Length 16</strong></p>
<pre><code>v+CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
  `Hello, World!`P
</code></pre>
<p>There it is: <code>Hello, World!</code> This should be the shortest version there is.</p>

<p>This creates a range from 0 - 9, it is represented as an array so you can iterate over it, reverse it. Do anything you want!</p>

<p>Additionally you can use binary <code>|&gt;</code> to generate a range from [a, b]</p>

<pre><code> 0|&gt;4
</code></pre>

<p>the above generates: <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</code></p>

<h2>Length 4 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>true
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a boolean with a value of <code>true</code>. This isn't very interesting, unfortunately. </p>

<h2>Length 5 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>1?2:3
</code></pre>

<p>This is the ternary operator. This is the same as the following:</p>

<pre><code>if (1) { 2 } else { 3 }
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is the ternary is an expression so rather than doing:</p>

<pre><code>var a: String
if (goat.type == saanen) {
    a = "bleeeeeet"
} else {
    a = "baaaaaa";
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can do:</p>

<pre><code>var a: String = goat.type == saanen ? "bleeeeeet" : "baaaaaa"
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 6 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>(a)-&gt;a
</code></pre>

<p>This, obfuscated looking code is actually very simple. It defines a lambda, or anonymous function taking one argument, a, and returns it. Note the parenthesis are optional, the following is just as valid:</p>

<pre><code>a-&gt;a
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you were to call foo, it would return the value passed:</p>

<pre><code>print foo(123) // prints `123`
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>var a=1
</code></pre>

<p>This is the shortest assignment in Cheddar.</p>

<p>Additionally other ways of declaring variables</p>

<pre><code>const foo = bar        // constant
const foo: String = bar // Same but requires `bar` to be a specific type
var foo = bar       // Can be changed, so can the type
var foo: String = bar // Can be changed but only to another string
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 9 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>String::9
</code></pre>

<p>This shows a cool feature of Cheddar's called <strong>casting</strong>. Classes each have defined behavior for when any class (in this case Number), is cast to them. This would output <code>"9"</code>;</p>

<p>In this example String's Number cast is called which in turn casts to a string. You an also swap this around to do a number cast:</p>

<pre><code>Number::"9"
</code></pre>

<p>which would output a number <code>9</code>.</p>

<p>In the event a cast fails, Cheddar throws an error. I'm planning on adding an operator <code>castable</code> which checks if a certain value (LHS) can be cast into (RHS). Which would work like:</p>

<pre><code>if foo castable Number
    print Number::foo
</code></pre>

<div id="pu128" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/84851/run-stackylogic">StackyLogic</a></h1>
<h2>Factoid:</h2>
<p>StackyLogic is originially from a codegolf challenge, as seen in the link. It consists of a series of &quot;stacks&quot;, however there are no &quot;push&quot; operations.</p>
<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>
<p><code>&lt;</code></p>
<p>This is not a full program at all. This is just the pointer symbol. This symbol denotes where the pointer starts</p>
<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>?&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes a bit of input, and outputs it. It would be a cat program, if it looped, however Stackylogic possesses no loops.</p>
<p>First, the program will substitute the <code>?</code> for either a <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>, depending on input. Then, it will execute this command. <code>1</code> will make the pointer move down one, <code>0</code> will make it move up one. Then, upon discovering the empty stack (which are always implicitly exist), it will halt, and output the last executed command, either a <code>1</code>, or <code>0</code></p>
<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>?1&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>This program always outputs one, the <code>?</code> is never used. This is because, as stated in the previous snippet, <code>1</code> will move the pointer down one, and the implicit empty stack will cause the last executed command to be printed. the  <code>?</code> isn't used, because the pointer is never directed to it.</p>
<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>?
?&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>Our first program with multiple non-empty stacks.</p>
<p>This program outputs the result of an OR operation on two bits.</p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>It first substitutes the <code>?</code> under the pointer with a bit from input, and executes it. If it is a <code>1</code>, it will go forward, find the empty stack, halt and print <code>1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>?&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>If it is a zero, it will go up one, and act like the above code: it will substitute the <code>?</code> for a bit, execute it, and then move onto an empty stack and output it.</p>
<p>Note how the code after the first <code>?</code> is executed is the same as snippet 2</p>
<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1
??&lt;
</code></pre>
<p>This program, like the last program, outputs the OR of two bits. However, the <code>?</code>s are on the same line. if the first bit is one, it will move forward on to an empty stack, output <code>1</code>, if it is a 0, it will move back one, on to the one, and then move forward back on to the second <code>?</code>, again being identical to the length 2 snippet. This illustrates how multiple programs can have the same effect. You might have noticed that no new language features have been introduced this time. This is because they have all been introduced.</p>
<h3>Length 6 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1
?&lt;
0
</code></pre>
<p>This program outputs the not of one bit (the opposite of snippet 2). You might, by now, think that StackyLogic is really boring, and can't do anything interesting. This isn't (entirely) true. It can be used for more interesting things, <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/86292/55896">it just takes A LOT of characters</a>. However, even after these lots of characters, it is not capable of much computation, it cannot even store the input, most challenges are closed out to it (in fact, the linked example actually checks which year it is, if it divisible by 4, to see if it is a special case (not a leap year))</p>
<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>?&lt;
?1
?
</code></pre>
<p>This program &quot;nests&quot; an OR in a surrounding program. I say it nests it, because if the first bit is 1, it changes to be the exact same as the OR, and executes the same things. This program is (x AND (y OR z))</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't really know anymore decent snippets, there isn't much more to show. I plan on making another answer with my derivative, <a href="https://github.com/Destructible-Watermelon/Eseljik" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eseljik</a>, after I actually make the interpreter, but before that decide on the final part of the spec. Anyway, there are a lot more commands in Eseljik, so I shouldn't easily run out of things to show, like I have here.</p>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Though people occasionally stylize Perl as "PERL," it is in fact <a href="http://learn.perl.org/faq/perlfaq1.html#Whats-the-difference-between-perl-and-Perl-" rel="nofollow">not an acronym</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This has been relinquished to the community as a wiki. Please feel free to <a href="/posts/45018/edit">add snippets</a> as you see fit, but please try to retain the formatting used for snippets 1-6 since it looks so clean. :)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 27</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>sub{ $_=shift; lc }-&gt;('SE')
</code></pre>

<p>An anonymous subroutine: that is, one with no name. This one is followed immediately by <code>-&gt;(...)</code> for its arguments. This snippet also demonstrates a number of other features:</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp;<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/shift.html" rel="nofollow"><code>shift</code></a> acts on an array, lopping off the initial element and returning it; (2)&nbsp;<code>@_</code> is the array holding all the arguments passed to a subroutine; (3)&nbsp;<code>shift</code> with no arguments, in a subroutine, acts on <code>@_</code>. Thus, the first statement in our subroutine assigns to the variable <code>$_</code> the first argument passed to the subroutine, in this case <code>'SE'</code>.</p>

<p>(4)&nbsp;<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/lc.html" rel="nofollow"><code>lc</code></a> returns the lowercasified version of a string (without changing the original variable if the argument is a variable); (5)&nbsp;<code>lc</code> with no arguments acts on <code>$_</code>. Thus, here, <code>lc</code> acts on <code>$_</code> which is <code>'SE'</code> and returns <code>'se'</code>.</p>

<p>(6)&nbsp;If you reach the end of a subroutine (and thus haven't yet returned anything), the subroutine returns the return value of its last statement, if any. Thus, in this case, the subroutine returns <code>'se'</code>.</p>

<p>Note: Many of these features are very useful in code golf; in real life, for clarity's sake, you will often want to specify the arguments to functions rather than relying on default arguments like <code>$_</code>, and to specify return values of subroutines rather than relying on the return value of the last statement (especially if the last statement is complex).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 26</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>join '', split /\W/, $foo;
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates using a function (with its arguments, or a unary operator) as an argument to another function or unary operator. When, as here, the first function is the <strong>final</strong> parameter of the other, you usually don't need parentheses to disambiguate. They may be useful for clarity in some cases, but the <code>join... split...</code> construct is so well-known that you don't need parentheses here.</p>

<p><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/split.html" rel="nofollow"><code>split</code></a> takes two arguments. (Well, it can take zero to three, but it takes two in this case.) It splits the string <code>$foo</code> along demarcations matching the regular expression <code>/\W/</code>, and its return value is a list of the remaining substrings. <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/join.html" rel="nofollow"><code>join</code></a> puts those back together with the empty string between them. (Incidentally, <code>$foo =~ s/\W//g</code> is a simpler way to accomplish the same thing.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 25</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>sub foo {
    return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our first subroutine! In a later snippet, we'll see how to use arguments (parameters) passed to a subroutine; for now, our subroutine just returns <code>1</code> back to whatever called it. Our subroutine is called <code>foo</code>; anonymous subroutines are also possible and will be covered in a later snippet.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 24</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>my $has_nums = $x=~/\d+/
</code></pre>

<p>See the length-23 snippet. Like that one, this, too, binds <code>$x</code> to a regular expression, and almost the same one. (Like <code>/(\d+)/</code>, it looks for a string of digits.) But this one is being assigned to <code>$has_nums</code> rather than to a list, so it's being called in scalar context. The binding operator <code>=~</code> in scalar context, when the right-hand side is <code>/.../</code>, returns <code>1</code> (which is true) or the empty string (which is false) depending on whether the match succeeds. So now you can use <code>$has_nums</code> in <code>if $has_nums</code>, for example. (What <code>=~</code> returns in scalar context is different if its right-hand side is <code>s/.../.../</code> or some other things.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 23</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>my ($num) = $x=~/(\d+)/
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates <code>=~</code>, called the binding operator. It binds (in this case) <code>$x</code> to the regular expression <code>/(\d+)/</code>. Like just about everything in Perl, this operator returns something, and what it returns depends on what context it's called in. Assigning the binding operator's return to a list <code>($num)</code> is calling it in list context. The binding operator in list context, when it's binding to just a regular expression <code>/.../</code>, returns the list of matches to the stuff in parentheses in the regular expression, which in this case is <code>\d+</code>, a string of digits. So <code>$num</code> is assigned to the first string of digits within <code>$x</code>. (What <code>=~</code> returns in list context is different if its right-hand side is <code>/.../g</code> or <code>s/.../.../</code> or other things.) See also the length-24 snippet.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 22</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>$x = 1==0 ? 'a' : 'b';
</code></pre>

<p><code>... ? ... : ...</code> is the ternary operator. It has precedence over comparison operators like <code>==</code> but not over assignment operators like <code>=</code>, so the above means the same as <code>$x = ( (1==0) ? 'a' : 'b')</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 21</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>if ($x) {
    # ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates Perl comments, which are from <code>#</code> to the end of the line, and the common practice of indenting four spaces for clarity. (There are other ways to comment, too, but those will have to wait for a later snippet. This snippet also tests <code>$x</code> for truthiness, but truthiness, too, will have to wait.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 20</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>next LBL if $x &gt;= 0;
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates Perl's use of postfix <code>if</code>. (It means the same as <code>if ($x &gt;= 0) {next LBL;}</code>.) Postfix control-flow statements are usually (outside of golfing) reserved for things like <code>next</code> and <code>last</code> and <code>warn</code> and <code>die</code> where the point of postfixing is to draw attention to the crucial command being conditionally executed.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 19</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>$_ = 'quux';
print;
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates Perl's use of a default input for (many) built-in functions. If you don't say <em>what</em> you want to <code>print</code> (or <code>lcfirst</code> or <code>sqrt</code> or <code>split</code> or&hellip;), Perl will do it to <code>$_</code>. (The same is true for binding to a pattern match, and <code>$_</code> is the default scalar used in other circumstances also &mdash; but those will have to wait for a later snippet.) For clarity and to ensure you're using the variable you think you're using, it's often best to use some variable other than <code>$_</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 18</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>@hsh{'Ann', 'Bob'}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a hash <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldata.html#Slices" rel="nofollow">slice</a>. As in the Length 17 note, below, the <code>{...}</code> (rather than <code>[...]</code>) signifies that <code>%hsh</code> is a hash. And the <code>@</code> sigil here signifies we're making a list of our hash values. Which hash values? The ones with the keys listed. So if <code>%hsh</code> is <code>('Ann' =&gt; 123, 'Bob' =&gt; 345, 'Cam' =&gt; 567)</code> then <code>@hsh{'Ann', 'Bob'}</code> is <code>(123, 345)</code>. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>$ary[0] = $hsh{a}
</code></pre>

<p><code>$</code> is the sigil for a scalar. But an element of an array, or a value of a hash, is a scalar. So even though may call an array <code>@ary</code> and a hash <code>%hsh</code>, their values are <code>$ary[...]</code> and <code>$hsh{...}</code>. The type of bracket indicates whether it's an array or a hash.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>print$x=&lt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a “one-line <code>cat</code>” program: it outputs one line of its input, then exits.  It demonstrates several features of the language.  The null filehandle is used again, now to assign a line of input to the variable <code>$x</code>.  This assignment also <em>returns</em> the value, which is then printed to STDOUT.  But wait!  Didn't <code>&lt;&gt;</code> return the <em>whole file</em> in Snippet 7, not just one line?  Perl statements know about the “context” they're evaluated in.  In “scalar context”, <code>&lt;&gt;</code> reads one line.  In “list context” it reads (“slurps”) the whole file at once; the result is a list with one element for each line.  <code>print</code> provides a list context (and concatenates its argument list), but assignment to the scalar variable <code>$x</code> enforces scalar context.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 7:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>print&lt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This, like <code>cat</code>, prints back its input.  The <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is the “null filehandle”; its lack of a name means that it reads from the “magical” filehandle <code>ARGV</code>, which sequentially opens and reads from filenames given as line arguments, or <code>STDIN</code> if there are no arguments (just like <code>cat</code> does).  In the full form, the filehandle goes between the angle brackets: <code>&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;</code> may also be spelled <code>readline(*FILEHANDLE)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 6:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>Int $x
</code></pre>

<p>Perl 5 is all dynamic typing. But Perl 6 supports both static and dynamic typing! It's one of the many ways in which the two versions have diverged.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 5:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>'$x'
</code></pre>

<p>This may seem trivial but it's something that can confuse people new to Perl who are familiar with other languages. In some languages, it doesn't matter whether you use single or double quotes. It does in Perl, though. If you have a variable <code>$x</code> equal to 5, <code>"$x"</code> returns <code>"5"</code> and <code>'$x'</code> returns <code>'$x'</code>. Perl interprets things in double quotes but uses anything in single quotes literally.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 4:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>less
</code></pre>

<p>The Perl pragma to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bingos/perl/lib/less.pm" rel="nofollow">use less of something</a>, available in CPAN. Examples include <code>use less 'fat';</code> for those on a diet, or <code>use less 'CPU';</code> for those whose computers are on diets. The class method <code>less-&gt;of('x')</code> will tell you if <code>use less 'x';</code> was specified. Unless you take advantage of that class method in some way, specifying <code>use less</code> is useless. (See what I did there?)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 3:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>use
</code></pre>

<p>Perl is extensible via modules, which are loaded using <code>use</code>. Other things use <code>use</code> too. Show self-discipline; <code>use strict; use warnings;</code> in your programs.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 2:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>$!
</code></pre>

<p>Oh no, something has gone wrong! The program has died, be it intentionally (via <code>die</code>) or by the will of Zeus. But why oh <em>why</em> has execution stopped? At last, <code>$!</code> rides the Perl camel to the rescue. It contains the error code. (There's also <code>$@</code>, which contains the error message.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 1:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-perl prettyprint-override"><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>Like so many other 1 character answers here, <code>;</code> is a valid Perl statement which does nothing. On its own it's about as useful as vacuuming a block of tofu.</p>

<div id="pu131" class="pu"><h1>GolfScript</h1>

<p>Weird how nobody's done this one yet, as it's quite popular on this site.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Written and released in 2007, <a href="http://www.golfscript.com/golfscript/" rel="nofollow">GolfScript</a> is probably the first esoteric programming language invented for the purpose of code golf. Since then, it's inspired <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cjam/" rel="nofollow">CJam</a>, <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Pyth" rel="nofollow">Pyth</a>, <a href="http://rebmu.hostilefork.com/" rel="nofollow">Rebmu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nooodl/gs2" rel="nofollow">gs2</a>, and maybe others.</p>

<h3>1 character</h3>

<pre><code>,
</code></pre>

<p>GolfScript is a stack-based language, and all of standard input is pushed onto the stack when the program starts. The <code>,</code> command pops a value, and, if it is an array or string, pushes back its length. At the end of the program, every value on the stack is printed, bottom-to-top. Thus, this program calculates the <strong>length</strong> of whatever input you pass it, like <code>wc -c</code>! Our 1-character program is already a useful tool.</p>

<h3>2 characters</h3>

<pre><code>~~
</code></pre>

<p>This program <strong>prints the bitwise NOT</strong> of a number given on standard input. For example, when you pass it a file containing <code>5</code>, it will print <code>-6</code>.</p>

<p>This, of course, showcases a trick GolfScript uses to cut down code size: not only does it assign operations to lots of single ASCII characters, it also assigns <em>multiple</em> meanings to each character depending on the type(s) of the value(s) popped.</p>

<p>For example, <code>~</code> on strings is <code>eval()</code>, which is the simplest way to read a number from a string in GolfScript. It pops a string and executes it as code, pushing back an integer in our case. Applying <code>~</code> again to this integer, it does something very different: namely, compute the bitwise NOT of the given value and push it back.</p>

<h3>3 characters</h3>

<pre><code>-1%
</code></pre>

<p>This program <strong>reverses standard input.</strong> <code>-1</code> pushes -1 to the stack, and <code>&lt;string&gt; &lt;int&gt; %</code> corresponds to Python's <code>string[::n]</code> behavior: it steps through characters from the string from one end to another with the given step size.</p>

<h3>4 characters</h3>

<pre><code>{+}*
</code></pre>

<p>This is the idiomatic GolfScript to write <code>sum()</code>, i.e., the sum of values in an array (or string, which is just a special kind of array). It will sum together the ASCII values in the standard input string, or whichever list is on top of the stack. <code>{+}</code> is a block, representing some GolfScript code (<code>+</code>), and it is folded <code>*</code> over its bottom argument. This has a precise meaning:</p>

<pre><code>    [a b c d e] {∘} *

==  a b ∘ c ∘ d ∘ e ∘
</code></pre>

<p>i.e., it is a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Fold" rel="nofollow">left fold</a> with the first element of the list as the initial value.</p>

<h3>5 characters</h3>

<pre><code>2base
</code></pre>

<p>Ironically, GolfScript has commands that are longer than one character, for... no reason at all. (Well, when I asked Darren about it in an email, a long time ago, he said he simply didn't want the language to be frustrating to program in, and keywords like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>base</code> are probably easier to remember than single characters!)</p>

<p>The <code>base</code> command takes a positive base <em>n</em> as an argument, and performs a conversion between lists of base-<em>n</em> digits and integer values. Applying <code>2base</code> to a list like <code>[1 1 0]</code> will yield <code>6</code>, and vice versa.</p>

<h3>6 characters</h3>

<pre><code>n/.&amp;n*
</code></pre>

<p><code>n</code> pushes a newline to the stack, and <code>/</code> and <code>*</code> are the split/join commands to convert between lists and strings. So, this first splits the input string into lines, does something to that list of lines, and joins it back into one long string with newline characters in it.</p>

<p>But what does it do? <code>.</code> is a stack operation that duplicates the top element on the stack, which is now our list of lines, twice. <code>&amp;</code> will pop these two lists and compute their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)" rel="nofollow">set intersection</a>. That's sort of weird; we're computing <em>L ∩ L</em>, which set theory tells us is just <em>L</em>. This is a little GolfScript trick, though (and it also works in CJam): the implementation simply calls Ruby's <code>&amp;</code>, which does the same, and has the additional result of <strong>removing duplicates</strong> from the list, while preserving their order.</p>

<p>So we have a 6-character program to remove duplicate lines from standard input.</p>

<h3>7 characters</h3>

<pre><code>{,}$-1=
</code></pre>

<p><code>[list] [block] $</code> is "sort by", which is a very powerful tool: it will sort the array by whatever function the block represents. Here, <code>,</code> is "length", and the snippet expects a list of strings on top of the stack. It will sort the list by length, and then extract the final element (<code>-1=</code> indexes the list) to find the <strong>longest string in the list</strong>.</p>

<h3>8 characters</h3>

<pre><code>":n`":n`
</code></pre>

<p>The shortest GolfScript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)" rel="nofollow">quine</a>. Note that e.g. <code>1</code> isn’t a <em>real</em> quine: that prints <code>1\n</code>! How does this all make sense?</p>

<p>At the end of program execution, GolfScript <a href="https://github.com/mtolly/golfscript/blob/master/test/golfscript.rb#L487" rel="nofollow">wraps the current stack in a <code>GArray</code></a> and evaluates <code>puts</code>, which is by default defined as <code>print n print</code>.</p>

<p>What we do, then, is assign the string <code>":n&#96;"</code> to <code>n</code>, and then inspect (<code>&#96;</code>) it to push <code>"\":n&#96;\""</code> on the stack. The implicit printing of <code>n</code> that happens at the end of our program is now exactly what we need to finish our quine!</p>

<h3>9 characters</h3>

<pre><code>"#{size}"
</code></pre>

<p>GolfScript is implemented in Ruby, and it <a href="https://github.com/mtolly/golfscript/blob/master/test/golfscript.rb#L401" rel="nofollow">uses <code>eval</code></a> to read its string literals. This means you can “statically” call any Ruby code you want! In this case, the <code>size</code> method call is evaluated on <code>"\"#{size}\""</code> (I’m not sure why) and the result is the string <code>"9"</code>. That string is, again, implicitly printed, so this program just outputs its own size: <code>9</code>.</p>

<h3>10 characters</h3>

<pre><code>{9(:9.(}do
</code></pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>87654321
</code></pre>

<p>First, <code>do</code> is one of GolfScript’s flow control structures: <code>{thing}do</code> in pseudocode is like <code>do { thing } while popStack() is truthy</code>. Our <code>thing</code> is <code>9(:9.(</code>. That’s <code>push 9</code>, <code>decrement</code>, <code>assign to 9</code> (yes!), <code>duplicate</code>, <code>decrement</code>.</p>

<p>The assignment to <code>9</code> is the tricky bit! Pushing an integer literal <a href="https://github.com/mtolly/golfscript/blob/master/test/golfscript.rb#L402" rel="nofollow">isn’t exempt from a variable lookup</a> in GolfScript; when you push <code>9</code> for the first time, a variable called <code>9</code> gets assigned the value of <code>t.to_i == 9</code> on the fly. There’s not actually much special about this variable, and as you can see, assigning to it is A-OK.</p>

<p>(This is actually useful: instead of starting with <code>0:x;</code> and then updating <code>x</code> a lot, you can often just work with <code>0</code> itself as a pre-initialized variable.)</p>

<p>As a condition, we have <code>.(</code>: loop until whatever is on the stack, minus one, is falsey, i.e. zero. So we push decrements of <code>9</code> until they reach <code>1</code>, i.e. <code>8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1</code>. These all get printed after each other without spaces in-between by the implicit <em>wrap-and-<code>print</code></em> at the end of the program.</p>

<p>Factoid: LiveScript was on of the early names of JavaScript (mocha is another one), before the need to "make it feel entreprise-y" came up.
The language offers features that spans in different paradigms (mostly functional and object-oriented).</p>

<p>The pipe is, like in F#, a "reversed" function application: the above is equivalent to <code>f(v)</code>.</p>

<p>As a bonus, the opposite operator also exists: (like <code>$</code> in Haskell)</p>

<pre><code>f&lt;|v
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to <code>f(v)</code> (this is useful for precedence).</p>

<p>(of the two, <code>&lt;|</code> has lowest precedence).</p>

<h3>5 votes</h3>

<pre><code>class
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, this actually works as a standalone anonymous classes. They're values, and very powerful – they have executable bodies (a bit like Ruby). This allows to declare method on-the-fly, but that's going to be a bit later :).</p>

<h3>6 votes</h3>

<pre><code>"#{3}"

<p>String interpolation! It's particularly powerful in LiveScript, where there's even a shortcut for interpolation variables – the braces aren't needed: <code>"#x"</code></p>

<h3>7 votes</h3>

<pre><code>-&gt;|_=&gt;1
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit useless as-is... but in LiveScript, <code>switch</code>es are implicit right after a function declaration (<code>-&gt;</code>), and a case can also be spelled <code>|</code> (ML-style). The <code>=&gt;</code> is an alias for <code>then</code> (but doesn't require spaces around it), and <code>_</code> is a catch-all.</p>

<p>This is basically the sugar-y syntax for (a topic-less <code>switch</code> will switch on truthiness):</p>

<pre><code>-&gt;
 switch
 # case ...
 otherwise
   1
</code></pre>

<h3>8 votes</h3>

<pre><code>@a{}b[]c
</code></pre>

<p><code>@a</code> is simply <code>@.a</code>, which is... <code>this.a</code>! The language inserts dot for you in my places.</p>

<p>In LiveScript, <code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code> used as infix operators (they're actually infix dot operators, the real spelling is <code>.{}</code> and <code>.[]</code>, but those dots can be inferred) are (semi)autovivification (like in Perl)/shaping member access.</p>

<p>(contrarily to perl, you need to use <code>{}</code> and <code>[]</code>, hence the <strong>semi</strong>autovivification)</p>

<p>It means <code>a{}b</code> (or <code>a.{}b</code>) tries to access <code>a.b</code>, but if that key doesn't exist (or is <code>== null</code>), it creates it as an empty object (<code>{}</code>). For <code>a[]b</code>, it does the same, but initializes an empty array (<code>[]</code>) instead.</p>

<p>The postfix <code>!</code> is actually simply <code>()</code>, an argumentless call. Here again, the language will insert dot as needed:</p>

<pre><code>a!b
a()b
# both mean
a().b
# and equally...
a()['b']

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Jelly is inspired by J and, in particular, its trains. Everything in Jelly &ndash; including literals &ndash; is a <em>link</em> (function), and you can combine several links by simply <em>chain</em>ing them together.</p>

<p>As a tacit language, Jelly programs usually do not require variable references. Also &ndash; like J &ndash; many of Jelly's <em>atoms</em> (built-in functions) vectorize automatically. This makes Jelly fairly competitive in code golf competitions.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<pre><code>b
</code></pre>

<p>This full program is a neat little base conversion utility. It takes an integer <strong>n</strong> as left and a base <strong>k</strong> as right argument (resp., first and second command-line argument) and converts <strong>n</strong> to base <strong>k</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, since integer-to-base conversion only makes sense if both arguments are numbers, the atom <code>b</code> vectorizes with depth <strong>0</strong>, meaning that it "searches" for corresponding numbers in <strong>b</strong> and <strong>k</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, <code>[n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>] b [k<sub>1</sub>,k<sub>2</sub>]</code> converts <strong>n<sub>1</sub></strong> to base <strong>k<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>n<sub>2</sub></strong> to base <strong>k<sub>2</sub></strong>, while <code>[n<sub>3</sub>,n<sub>4</sub>] b k<sub>0</sub></code> converts both <strong>n<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>n<sub>4</sub></strong> to base <strong>k<sub>0</sub></strong>. Moreover, the list don't have to be rectangular. Combining the two previous examples, <code>[[n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>],[n<sub>3</sub>,n<sub>4</sub>]] b [[k<sub>1</sub>,k<sub>2</sub>],k<sub>0</sub>]</code> gives the same results as before.</p>

<pre><code>»\
</code></pre>

<p>Aside from atoms, Jelly has <em>quicks</em>. While a few of them are similar to atoms and simply execute some code, the vast majority affect the behavior of one or more atoms to their left.</p>

<p>For example <code>»</code> on its own is a dyadic atom that returns the maximum of two numbers. The quick <code>\</code> pops the link <code>»</code> from the current chain and pushes the <em>quicklink</em> <code>»\</code> in return, which performs a cumulative reduce by maximum, i.e., it computes the cumulative maxima of a list of numbers or characters.</p>

<p>For example, <code>[n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>,n<sub>3</sub>,n<sub>4</sub>] »\</code> computes <strong>max(n<sub>1</sub>)</strong>, <strong>max(n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>)</strong>, <strong>max(n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>)</strong> and finally  <strong>max(n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>, n<sub>4</sub>)</strong>, and returns the list of all four results.</p>

<pre><code>+×_
</code></pre>

<p>Any chain of links is parsed in a particular fashion, which depends both on the arities of the involved links (i.e., the number of arguments they expect) and the arity of the chain (i.e., the number of arguments passed to the chain).</p>

<p>If the above full program is executed with two arguments <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, <em>sum</em>, <em>multiplication</em> and <em>difference</em> are all dyads, <code>+×_</code> becomes a dyadic <em>fork</em>; the outmost links are evaluated first, then the inner link is called on both results. In this particular example, the result is <strong>(a + b) × (a - b) = a² - b²</strong>.</p>

<p>If the program is executed with a single argument <strong>c</strong>, each of the links in <code>+×_</code> is a monadic <em>hook</em>, meaning that is gets called with te previous return value &ndash; initially the input argument &ndash; and the input argument. Our example thus computes <strong>((c + c) × c) - c = 2c² - c</strong>.</p>

<p>The code consists of three monadic atoms (<em>decrement</em>, <em>factorial</em>, <em>square</em>), which are parsed as <em>atops</em> (i.e., they are applied one after the other, each on top of the previous one), and the dyadic <em>modulus</em> &ndash; a hook &ndash; which gets called with the previous return value and the original <strong>n</strong> as left and right arguments.</p>

<p>Jelly has built-in string compression. While it has a few limitations &ndash; only produces printable ASCII and only compresses dictionary words &ndash; it performs rather well under these conditions.</p>

<p>The characters between <code>“</code> and <code>»</code> are replaced with their indices in <a href="https://github.com/DennisMitchell/jelly/wiki/Code-page" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jelly's code page</a>, which are then interpreted as the as digits of a bijective base-250 number.

</div>
<div id="pu135" class="pu"><h1>TI-99/4 GPL byte codes</h1>

<h3>Factoid:</h3>

<p>GPL stands for Graphics Programming Language. It is a byte-wise interpreted language that is found in GROMs in both the console and cartridges. GROMs are 6k ROMs with an internal 16-bit address counter. The upper three bits determine which GROM will respond. Most instructions can access CPU memory or video memory with ease. Which is important as the console only has 256 bytes of CPU RAM. It was introduced on the TI-99/4 in 1979 and also used on the TI-99/4A.</p>

<p>Note: All bytes and addresses are in hexadecimal.</p>

<h3>Length 1:</h3>

<pre><code>03   ; SCAN
</code></pre>

<p>This will scan the keyboard and/or joysticks using the mode found in CPU byte 8374 and place the scan code in 8375. Joystick displacements may be placed in 8376 (x) and 8377 (y), depending on the mode.</p>

<h3>Length 2:</h3>

<pre><code>07 20    ; ALL ' '
</code></pre>

<p>This will fill the first 768 (32x24) bytes of video memory with spaces. In the default video memory layout, this fills the entire screen with the given character. No provisions are made for different layouts or 40 column mode which uses 960 (40x24) bytes. The TMS9918A Video Display Processor (vdp) can place the screen on 1K boundaries and the character definitions on 2K boundaries. To maximize space for tokens and variables, BASIC places both of these overlapping at the beginning of the 16K video memory. This makes the first 96 character definitions unusable, so BASIC has a bias added to the ascii values on the screen. Provisions are made in several rom routines to accommodate this bias.</p>

<h3>Length 3:</h3>

<pre><code>95 A1 23    ; DINCT V@0123
</code></pre>

<p>This adds 2 to video memory word 0123. A word on the TI is 2 bytes, msb first. Most instructions can operate on a byte or word, in video and/or CPU memory. For video memory addresses from 0F00 to 3FFF, the encoding takes one more byte. Address encoding can get quite involved, including indirection and indexing.</p>

<h3>Length 4:</h3>

<pre><code>A0 A1 23 10    ; ADD @8310, V@0123
</code></pre>

<p>This adds CPU byte 8310 to video memory byte 0123. For CPU addresses 8300 to 837F, the encoding only takes 1 byte. Also, all CPU addresses have a bias of 8300 added to the encoded value. This is because the fast 256 bytes of CPU ram is at 83xx. For two operand instructions, like this, the destination is encoded first.</p>

<h3>Length 5:</h3>

<pre><code>08       ; FMT
21 48 49 ; VTEX 'HI'
FB       ; FEND
</code></pre>

<p>This will draw the string 'HI' vertically at the current display location, stored in CPU byte 837E (row) and 837F (col). GPL has an alternate interpreter known as the format sub-interpreter. The first and last lines enter and exit the sub-interpreter, respectively. Most of the FMT commands use the lower 5 bits of the opcode as a count, 1 to 32, encoded as one less than the count.</p>

<h3>Length 6:</h3>

<pre><code>30 10 A0 00 80 00    ; MOVE @8310, G@8000, V@0000
</code></pre>

<p>This will move the number of bytes in CPU word 8310 from GROM address 8000 to the beginning of video memory. Move is possibly the most powerful GPL command. It can use GROM address space as source or destination, in addition to using the usual address encoding. It can also use the read only video controller registers as a destination.</p>

<h3>Length 7:</h3>

<pre><code>06 00 34 ; CALL BEEP
03       ; L1: SCAN
40 13    ; BR L1
0B       ; EXIT
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a real program that beeps once, waits for a key, and then resets the console. TI defined several fixed entry points for GPL calls such as BEEP, which plays a 1397 Hz tone for 200 ms. SCAN was used in the length 1 snippet. It also returns the condition (cnd) bit set if a new key was detected. BR <em>B</em>ranches to the label if the cnd bit is <em>R</em>eset. Individual GROMs are 6K bytes on 8K boundaries and the BR and BS (<em>B</em>ranch if cnd is <em>S</em>et) instructions are limited to targets in the current GROM. Cartridges are given complete control over the console, so an EXIT resets back to the power on screen.</p>

<h3>Length 8:</h3>

<pre><code>0F 17    ; COSX2: XML VPUSH
0F 0D    ; XML SMUL
06 00 2C ; CALL COS
00       ; RTN
</code></pre>

<p>This makes a subroutine that returns cos(x<sup>2</sup>). Where the input and output are the floating point value in CPU ram 834A. XML is e<em>X</em>ecute <em>M</em>achine <em>L</em>anguage procedure. The second byte of the XML instruction defines the table (upper nibble) and index in that table (lower nibble) to get the address to execute. The first two tables (0x and 1x) are predefined in rom. VPUSH pushes the float at 834A onto the floating point stack in video memory. SMUL multiplies the float at 834A with the top of the floating point stack. COS calculates the cosine of the float at 834A (in radians). RTN returns back to the caller. The TI floating point format is 8 bytes with the first byte the exponent and the remaining 7 bytes are base 100 digits. This yields 14 decimal digits of precision. Not bad for 1979.</p>

<h3>Length 9:</h3>

<pre><code>07 20                 ; ALL ' '
35 00 C0 A3 00 A2 FF  ; MOVE 192, V@02FF, V@0300
</code></pre>

<p>This is what is needed to clear the screen in 40 column mode as noted in the length 2 snippet. This assumes that the screen is at the beginning of the video memory. The move copies the last byte filled by ALL to the remainder of the screen. This trick to fill memory by setting the move destination one more than the source is used in the TI GROMs quite a bit. Here we see move with an immediate count showing how flexible this instruction can be. Also, note that the built-in BASIC cannot use 40 column mode because of the video memory layout mentioned in the length 2 snippet. Extended BASIC with the expansion ram can use all of the video memory for video.</p>

<h3>Length 10:</h3>

<pre><code>0E C2     ; PARS &gt;C2
83 4A     ; DNEG @834A
C6 4C 63  ; CH 99, @834C
76 71     ; BS 5671
10        ; CONT
</code></pre>

<p>This is an actual snippet from the built-in BASIC GROM called when an unary minus token is encountered. PARS and CONT are GPL commands that are only used by BASIC. PARS parses BASIC tokens until it reaches a token that is smaller than the value given. CONT continues the BASIC interpreter. The TI floating point format indicates a negative value by negating the first word. CPU address 834A is the current floating point value as mentioned in the length 8 snippet. CH sets the cnd bit if the destination is larger (unsigned comparison) than the source. BS jumps to GROM address 5671 to display an error message if the byte at CPU address 834C is greater than 99. This is the second base 100 digit of the floating point value. Since BASIC is written in GPL and GPL is also interpreted, the BASIC interpreter is painfully slow. </p>

<h3>Length 11:</h3>

<pre><code>02 FF       ; RAND 255
BC B0 00 78 ; ST @8378, V*8300
91 00       ; DINC @8300
90 78       ; INC @8378
01          ; RTNC
</code></pre>

<p>This is a routine that places a random byte at video memory pointed to by CPU word 8300, increments the pointer, then returns the cnd bit set if the number was 255. RAND n puts a random number between 0 and n into CPU byte 8378. ST copies that byte to video memory. V*8300 indicates indirection into video memory, but all pointers can only be in CPU memory.  DINC increments a word. INC increments a byte and sets the cnd bit if the result is zero. RTNC returns from the routine without clearing the cnd bit. Normally, calls, returns, and branches clear the cnd bit. This feature can be used to create a fixed entry point table using BR which is a byte smaller than B (unconditional branch). This was used by TI as mentioned in the length 7 snippet.</p>

I'll redirect my focus to more important things (for instance showing of the awesomeness of Octave) when I have some spare time. Until then, please have some patience =)</p>

<hr>

<p>Octave and MATLAB are very similar, and many of the nice features <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/24877/flawr">flawr</a> has showcased would be good showcases for Octave as well. I will try to avoid reusing any of the material flawr has <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44702/31516">already used</a>.</p>

<li>Decimal point, of course: <code>314/100</code>, <code>3.14</code>, and <code>.314e1</code> are all the same.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>++
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/v4.0.1/Increment-Ops.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Increment operators</a> are one of the great features in Octave, that doesn't exist in MATLAB. It's known to most programmers as languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP and Perl all support it. Nevertheless, it's awesome when golfing, and often makes Octave submissions a bit more competitive than MATLAB. <code>x++</code> is 2 bytes shorter than <code>x=x+1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Snippets 3:</strong></p>

<p>Edit: 02.05.2016 - I'll get to this ASAP! </p>

<p><strong>Snippet 4:</strong></p>

<pre><code>a+a'
</code></pre>

<p>This is a great way to create a grid of values, similar to <code>meshgrid</code> in MATLAB.</p>

<pre><code>a = 0:3;
a+a'
ans =    
   0   1   2   3
   1   2   3   4
   2   3   4   5
   3   4   5   6
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course use this with vectors of different lengths. <code>a+b'</code> produces the same result as:</p>

<pre><code>bsxfun(@plus,a,b')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Snippet 5:</strong></p>

<pre><code>a=b=1
</code></pre>

<p>In Octave, you assign a value to several variables at the same time. The MATLAB equivalent is 7 bytes: <code>a=1;b=1</code></p>

<p><strong>Snippet 6:</strong></p>

<p>Edit: 02.05.2016: Octave is way better than MATLAB for golfing. More snippets = More possibilities to demonstrate. I'll get to this ASAP! </p>

<div id="pu140" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Thue" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Thue</a></h1>

<p>Thue (the correct pronounciation is either "TOO-eh" or "TOO-ay", I've heard both) is a language based on nondeterministic string rewriting. It is presumably named after Norwegian mathematitcian Axel Thue. A program consists of a list of zero or more substitution rules (terminated by the null rule), followed by a string indicating the initial state.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1:</strong> <code>~</code></p>

<p>Prepending a tilde to the right side of a rule is the language's only way to produce output. Basically, when that rule is applied, the target substring, instead of being replaced with the string on the right side of the rule, is removed and the remainder of the string (everything after the <code>~</code>) on the right side of the rule is printed to the output. (A rule may be applied to any substring of the state which matches the rule's left side.)</p>

<p>When used in this way, a tilde is often read as "print".</p>

<p><strong>Length 3:</strong> <code>::=</code></p>

<p>These three characters (typically read as "can mean") are used to separate the left side of a rule from the right side.</p>

<p>When both sides of a rule are empty, it serves as the null rule, which terminates the rule list (what should happen when only the left side is empty is undefined, most implementations treat it as equivalent to both sides being empty. It is, however, perfectly valid for only the right side to be empty.)</p>

<p><strong>Length 4:</strong> <code>0::=</code></p>

<p>This is a complete rule dictating that instances of the substring "0" may be removed and discarded.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5:</strong> <code>0::=0</code></p>

<p>This is a complete rule dictating that instances of the substring "0" may be replaced with... itself. This can be used to construct a simple infinite loop, as seen <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/59347/shortest-infinite-loop-producing-no-output/63812#63812">here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Length 6:</strong> <code>ab::=~</code></p>

<p>This is a complete rule dictating that instances of the substring "ab" may be removed, printing the empty string. As the specs don't actually provide any way of printing a newline, some implementations will do this when the empty string is printed.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7:</strong> <code>a::=:::</code></p>

<p>When three colons are used as the right side of a rule, this means the replacement string should be taken from STDIN. Thus, this rule dictates that instances of the substring "a" can be replaced with strings from STDIN.</p>

<p>Triple colons used in this way are read as "input".</p>

<p>Somebody's already done a CSS answer, but here's another one. I promise to make the one-char snippet exactly the same. :)</p>

<hr>

<h3>6 chars</h3>

<pre><code>:hover
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of a <em>pseudo-class</em>, which is basically the state of an element. The <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class applies when the element is being hovered over; some others are <code>:active</code> (mouse button down), <code>:valid</code>/<code>:invalid</code> (form/input is valid/invalid), and <code>:target</code> (element is target of current <code>#hash-portion-of-url</code>).</p>

<p>Pseudo-classes can also take arguments, for example <code>:not(some-other-selector)</code> and the <code>:nth-child</code> family: <code>:nth-child</code>, <code>:nth-last-child</code>, <code>:nth-of-type</code>, and <code>:nth-last-of-type</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>5 chars</h3>

<pre><code>--foo
</code></pre>

<p>CSS variables, properly known as <em>custom properties</em>, function like variables in other languages, only a bit more</p>

<pre><code>c
 a
  s
   c
    a
     d
      i
       n
        g
</code></pre>

<p>to fit in better with the nature of CSS. Variables are used like this:</p>

<pre><code>:root {
  --foo: goldenrod;
}

.some-element {
  background-color: var(--foo);
}

.another-element {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 3px solid var(--foo);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>var(--foo)</code> is replaced with the value of <code>--foo</code>.</p>

<p>However, because these variables are parsed at runtime, not as a compilation step in a preprocessor such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com" rel="nofollow">Sass</a> or <a href="http://lesscss.org" rel="nofollow">LESS</a>, they can be used more dynamically. For example:</p>

<pre><code>:root { --foo: red }
body:hover { --foo: blue }
p { color: var(--foo) }
</code></pre>

<p>This will make the text in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (paragraph) elements red, except when the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is hovered, in which case the text will turn blue.</p>

<hr>

<h3>4 chars</h3>

<pre><code>42cm
</code></pre>

<p>As well as the <code>px</code> (pixels), <code>em</code> (relative to font size), <code>rem</code> (relative to font size of root element), <code>vh</code> (1/100 of viewport height), and <code>vw</code> (1/100 of viewport width) units, which are usually what you use, CSS also has physical units for <code>cm</code>, <code>mm</code>, and <code>in</code>.  The only problem is that they don't necessarily represent physical centimetres, millimetres, and inches, but (device-dependent) may be relative to the assumption that 1 inch = 96px. Anyway, it's usually better to use relative units like <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> instead.</p>

<hr>

<h3>3 chars</h3>

<pre><code>-o-
</code></pre>

<p>Browser prefixes allow browsers to implement WIP standards before they've been finalised. The idea is that if the spec changes, the old implementation's behind a prefix so the correct implementation can be done without the prefix. However, browsers are moving away from prefixes in favour of flags set by the user in the browser (<code>chrome://flags</code> in Chrome and <code>about:config</code> in Firefox), as prefixes have caused headaches when trying to ensure compatibility with old browsers.</p>

<p>The prefix shown above is for Opera (before it switched to using the Blink rendering engine); the other prefixes are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-webkit-</code> for WebKit/Blink (Chrome, Opera, Safari)</li>
<li><code>-moz-</code> for Gecko (Firefox)</li>
<li><code>-ms-</code> for <em>that thing</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prefixes are used like this:</p>

<pre><code>.foo {
  -webkit-transform: rotateZ(30deg);
          transform: rotateZ(30deg);
}
</code></pre>

<p>They can also be used on selectors and property values.</p>

<p>People ask why CSS doesn't have <code>//</code> comments. Well it does. Sort of.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.xanthir.com/b4U10" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a>, Tab Atkins talks about using <code>//</code> comments in CSS. They don't function as line comments, but rather <em>"next construct comments"</em>. This means that these are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>foo {
  color: white;
  // font-weight: bold;
  background-color: black;
}

// bar {
  width: 12rem;
}

// @keyframes baz {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>foo {
  color: white;
  /* font-weight: bold; */
  background-color: black;
}

/* bar {
  width: 12rem;
} */

/* @keyframes baz {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
} */
</code></pre>

<p>There are also some weird tricks like using a <code>@comment {  }</code> block to simulate nested comments.</p>

<hr>

<h3>1 char</h3>

<p>Puts the number <code>2</code> topmost on your execution stack. Nothing fancy done with this yet, but hey, we have allocated some memory.</p>
<h3>Two char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>==
</code></pre>
<p>Print and remove topmost item in stack to stdout. Since not all systems are guaranteed to have a meaningful stdout this may in fact do nothing. Raises an error if stack is empty.</p>
<h3>Three char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>(a)
</code></pre>
<p>Push a string containing <code>a</code> to the stack.</p>
<h3>Four char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>save
</code></pre>
<p>Save the state of your virtual machine and put a save object on top of your stack. You can then use <code>restore</code> on this object to return to the global saved state at any time.</p>
<h3>Five char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>5 sin
</code></pre>
<p>Calculate the sine of 5 degrees. Postscript quite universally thinks of angles as degrees, as opposed to more mathematical radians of many languages use.</p>
<h3>Six char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>moveto
</code></pre>
<p>When executing drawing instructions, PostScript acts like a plotter (or pen in hand). The <code>moveto</code> command  moves the virtual pen to a location specified by the two topmost items on the stack; topmost being the y direction and the second the x direction.</p>
<h3>Seven char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1 2 add
</code></pre>
<p>And finally we have enough chars to actually compute something trivial. Here we push <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> to the stack. Calling <code>add</code> then pops them both, adds them together, and pushes the sum onto the stack. Leaving <code>3</code> on top of the stack.</p>
<h3>Eight char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>/v 9 def
</code></pre>
<p>Define symbol <code>v</code> as <code>9</code>. This is mostly equivalent to doing <code>v = 9</code> in most other languages. So now the previous example could look as <code>v 2 add</code> and it would result in 11 in the stack.</p>
<h3>Ten char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>0 2 8{}for
</code></pre>
<p>A for-loop.  Normally you'd add spaces around the function <code>{}</code> but I'm running out of chars. This produces numbers even numbers 0 through 8, as the stepping is 2. So the stack after this would be <code>0 2 4 6 8</code>. 20 more chars and we can start drawing stuff. (not a good language for golfing)</p>
<h3>Eleven char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>/a {add}def
</code></pre>
<p>Simple function definition; the function goes between the curly brackets and acts upon the stack. Note how it uses same mechanism as snippet 8. Now you could write the 7 char snippet as <code>1 2 a</code>.</p>
<h3>Twelve char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>4 3 gt{1} if
</code></pre>
<p>So here you go some flow control, if 4 is greater than (<code>gt</code>) 3 execute function <code>{}</code> which in this case deposits 1 in the stack.</p>
<h3>Thirteen char snippet</h3>
<p>0 0 6 0 5 arc</p>
<p>Make a 5 degree arc with a radius of 6 at the origin (0, 0). Note this does not actually draw anything yet; it prepares for drawing by constructing something that's called a 'user path'.</p>
<h3>Fourteen char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>20 0 translate
</code></pre>
<p>Changes the transformation matrix so that your drawings are henceforth positioned 20 units more right. This is useful if you want to repeat the same drawing routine in different places. PostScript coordinates are measured from the bottom left corner of your drawing surface and each unit is one PostScript Point (a unit Adobe invented) that is 1/72 of an inch.</p>
<h3>Eighteen char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>1 1 5 5 rectstroke
</code></pre>
<p>Draws a stroked rectangle onto the canvas in the lower left corner of your page.</p>
<h3>Twenty-one char snippet</h3>
<pre><code>4 4 moveto 2 5 lineto
</code></pre>
<p>Puts a line segment into the drawing buffer.</p>

<div id="pu145" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://bitbucket.org/thomas_bartscher/poslin/downloads" rel="nofollow">Poslin</a></h1>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>Poslin is a concatenative language with strict postfix notation and a metacircular interpreter.</p>

<p>It is similar to the language described in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD00xx/EWD28.html" rel="nofollow">EWD28</a> in principle but is not inspired by it.</p>

<p>Unlike the language described in the linked paper, the immediateness of a symbol is definable in code, allowing the programmer to define almost arbitrary new syntax.
Things like the symbol table and lexical environments exist as first class objects.</p>

<p>Every token in Poslin is surrounded by whitespace.</p>

<h2>Length 1 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>!
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually not a working program. Executing it in a fresh session gives a <code>stack-bottom-error</code>. This operation is immediate and executes the operation on top of the current stack. Without it, nothing would ever happen.</p>

<h2>Length 2 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>&amp;+
</code></pre>

<p>This also isn't a working program. <code>&amp;</code> is an immediate operation to compile something into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_code" rel="nofollow"><em>thread</em></a>. <code>&amp;+</code> also is an immediate operation, but after compiling it executes the operation stored at a place accessible via <code>HOOK compilation-hook slot-sub-get</code>.</p>

<p>This way users can define their own optimization passes.</p>

<h2>Length 3 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>[ ]
</code></pre>

<p>This creates an empty stack. <code>[]</code> also creates an empty stack ad does so much more efficiently. That's because Poslin works with something which is called the <em>path</em>. The path is a stack of <em>environments</em>, where environments are kind of like prototyped objects, that is, they are mappings (from symbols to bindings) which can have parent-environments. When some object is found by the reader which is not an immediate symbol, it is put onto a stack which is saved in a <em>binding</em> (besides the path, the return stack and arguably streams the only mutable data structures in poslin) which is found under the symbol <code>STACK</code> in the environment on top of the path.</p>

<p><code>[</code> puts a new environment onto the path which contains a fresh binding containing an empty stack for it's <code>STACK</code>. <code>]</code> pops the topmost environment off the path and then extracts the stack saved in the binding in its <code>STACK</code> slot.</p>

<p><code>[]</code> just constantly returns an empty stack.</p>

<p><code>[]</code>, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are all immediate.</p>

<h2>Length 4 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>'&amp; &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>There is no single operation in poslin which defines a new operation. Well, actually there are several, but they're all defined in the standard library, which is written in a subset of poslin called "poslin0".</p>

<p><code>&amp;</code> has the purpose of transforming a given object into a thread.</p>

<p>For threads it's just an identity operation.</p>

<p>Symbols are looked up in an environment saved in a binding in the <code>OP</code> slot of the environment on top of the path.</p>

<p>Stacks are converted by turning everything but threads into constant functions returning that object and then concatenating together the resulting objects into one thread. At least, that's roughly how it works. This means, of course, that any operation which should be called inside a thread created this way needs to be turned into a thread via <code>&amp;</code> before the calling thread is constructed.</p>

<p>Every other object is turned into a constant thread returning that exact object.</p>

<p><code>'&amp;</code> is special syntax: The leading <code>'</code> tells the reader that this is a quotation, that is, everything after the <code>'</code> is interpreted as a symbol (including any other <code>'</code>s) and then just put onto the current stack without checking for immediateness.</p>

<p>So the given snippet returns the thread of our poslin compiler. It is used in the operation <code>]o</code>, which defines a new operation. With the knowledge given up to this point, you might be able to figure out how defining an operation works conceptually, even if you are missing some important operations.</p>

<h2>Length 5 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>$:
":
</code></pre>

<p>This is the string you'd normally see as <code>"\""</code> in most other languages, that is, the string containing exactly the double-quote character.</p>

<p>The character <code>$</code> starts a <em>delimited string</em>. A delimited string has a delimiter, which is given between the <code>$</code> and the next newline. The string contains all characters between that newline and the next occurence of the delimiter <strong>followed by some kind of whitespace</strong>.</p>

<p>If the delimiter occurs and is not followed by whitespace, it is a part of the string and does not function as delimiter. Remember: Every token in Poslin is surrounded by whitespace.</p>

<p>So, the given string could also be written as</p>

<pre><code>$"
""
</code></pre>

<p>or even <code>"""</code>, as Poslin recognizes the usual syntax for strings, too. It does not recognize any escape sequences.</p>

<h2>Length 6 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>+ call
</code></pre>

<p>This is almost equivalent to <code>+ &amp;</code>. The important difference is that <code>+ &amp;</code> returns the thread of <code>+</code> while <code>+ call</code> returns a thread which reads the binding which holds the definition of <code>+</code> and then calls the content of that binding. So, if you expect that the definition of <code>+</code> might change and you need to call the new definition instead of the old one, use <code>+ call</code>.</p>

<p>This is necessary for defining recursive operations. There is no way to insert a thread into itself, so the binding which is later intended to contain the thread is inserted instead via <code>call</code> and after the thread is constructed it is written into that binding.</p>

<h2>Length 7 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>. ? ! !
</code></pre>

<p><code>?</code> consumes the top three elements off the stack. The third from the top needs to be a boolean value. If it is true, the second from top is put back onto the stack, if it is false the first from top is put back onto the stack.</p>

<p><code>.</code> is simply the no-op.</p>

<p>So this is an immediate <code>when</code>. Imagine the following stack:</p>

<pre><code>[ 2 TRUE P{negation} ]
</code></pre>

<p>This proceeds as follows with the above sequence:</p>

<pre><code>[ 2 TRUE P{negation} . ]
[ 2 TRUE P{negation} . ? ]
[ 2 P{negation} ]
[ -2 ]
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas if the stack is</p>

<pre><code>[ 2 FALSE P{negation} ]
</code></pre>

<p>It proceeds thus:</p>

<pre><code>[ 2 FALSE P{negation} . ]
[ 2 FALSE P{negation} . ? ]
[ 2 . ]
[ 2 ]
</code></pre>

<div id="pu146" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://factorcode.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Factor</a></h1>
<p><strong>Factor</strong> is a concatenative, stack-oriented and object-functional programming language first developed by Slava Pestov in 2003 as a <em>scripting</em> language for a game engine. Factor unites the simplicity and durability of Forth's stack-procedural paradigm and extensible word-based syntax, with the applicative, point-free and functional styles of Joy and Lisp.</p>
<p>In Factor, whitespace is the <code>apply</code> operator, the default operation. All words are first class objects; in fact, almost everything is a first-class object which means tons of possibility for extensible syntax, new types and literals, and all the other awesomeness introduced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Homoiconicity</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Forth, Factor prefers to use the many, many different higher-order words at its disposal over shuffle words, which should be avoided for the sake of readability and idiomaticity.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://factorcode.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">download a Factor binary</a>, or <a href="http://github.com/factor/factor" rel="nofollow noreferrer">find Factor in active development on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, its <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> is amazing, and the Listener UI / IDE (written in pure Factor) has the documentation offline and searchable. :D</p>
<p>I mentioned above that Factor was a scripting language -- that was back when it ran on the JVM, too. Factor, its runtime and its optimising native-code compiler are 97% pure Factor, with just 3% being low-level C++ for the VM and bootstrap.</p>
<p><sup><sup>I guess we'll go top-to-bottom, Iunno.</sup></sup></p>
<p><sup><a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/76437/46231">Link to this answer</a>, <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/posts/76437/edit">Link to Edit</a>.</sup></p>
<h3>Length 1</h3>
<p>For length 1, let's start at the most basic building block of Factor: the word that lets us make more words.</p>
<p><a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/75610">Factor's pretty verbose</a> so there's not much to do with one byte, because the &quot;words&quot; are literally <em>words</em>, and there's a lot of whitespace everywhere.</p>
<p>This means the fun in golfing comes not from shortening identifiers, but from re-<strong>Factor</strong>ing, which is where Factor gets its name. :D</p>
<p>Factor gets a lot of its pleasant syntax from Forth. The simplest flavour of <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-__colon__,syntax.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">word-definition word, <code>:</code></a> is an example.</p>
<p>Use it like:</p>
<pre><code>: word-name ( input -- output ) word-body ;
</code></pre>
<p>The word will then be callable by <code>word-name</code>, and <code>word-body</code> will execute, taking and putting things to and from the stack. <code>word-name</code>'s stack effect <em>must</em> match its actual effect on the stack. If <code>add</code> takes two numbers from the stack and adds them together, leaving the result on the stack,</p>
<pre><code>: add ( a b -- x ) + ;
</code></pre>
<p>Then its stack effect is that of the only word in its body (part of the power of concatenative languages). The identifiers in the effect don't matter, just that they are a proper representation.</p>
<h3>Length 2</h3>
<p>Another word-definition word, <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-__colon____colon__,locals.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>::</code></a>, allows the use of the <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-__colon____gt__,locals.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>:&gt;</code></a> lexical-variable-binding word, and causes inputs to be bound to the names in the stack effect.</p>
<pre><code>:: join-strings ( a b -- x ) a b suffix! ;
</code></pre>
<p>To bind a value to a name:</p>
<pre><code>:: var-demo ( a b c -- ) a c + b * sqrt :&gt; val ;
</code></pre>
<p><code>val</code> goes out of scope when the word is done executing.</p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>
<pre><code>[ ]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, I'll let you have a guess at what this is. Hint: It's not an array.</p>
<hr />
<p>You don't know?
It's a <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-%5B,syntax.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">quotation</a> -- it allows putting an executable block of literal code on the stack, that the higher-order functional and applicative words can manipulate.</p>
<p>Brackets for blocks come from Smalltalk syntax (with the <code>locals</code> vocabulary you also get <code>[| param | code ]</code> which kind of resembles Smalltalk's <code>[ :param | code ]</code>).</p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<p>I'll try to do something more interesting this time, as fede s. suggested in the comments:</p>
<pre><code>2bi@
</code></pre>
<p>Before I explain what this is, I should probably first explain something about Factor identifiers.</p>
<p>A valid Factor identifier is any string which matches the following:</p>
<pre><code>^[^&quot;][^\s]+$
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, that's it. Any identifier can contain any character that isn't whitespace, and it can't begin with one or more <code>&quot;</code>s, because strings are special to the lexer. It can have <code>&quot;</code> elsewhere within it, though.</p>
<p>The NUL byte, the character at UTF8 888 and the byte at 127, ASCII DEL are all valid identifiers. For portability, sometimes <code>SYMBOL</code>s may be stripped of their non-ASCII bytes (Windows, for instance).</p>
<p>This may be rather shocking to the C people and the Python people (and even the Lisp people, who allow some nice stuff in names), but fear not, for you will come to like it.</p>
<p>So <code>2bi@</code> is just one identifier, one name for one function. But what does it do? Well, the <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-bi,kernel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bi@</code></a> function applies one quotation to two items on the stack:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;5&quot; &quot;10&quot; [ string&gt;number ] bi@

--- Data stack:
5 
10
</code></pre>
<p>(bi stands for <a href="http://google.com/search?q=define:bifurcate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bifurcate</a>, if you were curious.)</p>
<pre><code>&quot;5&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;15&quot; &quot;20&quot; [ append string&gt;number ] 2bi@

--- Data stack:
510
1520
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-2bi__at__,kernel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>2bi@</code></a>, like <code>2map</code>, takes a quotation with stack effect <code>( obj1 obj2 -- ... )</code>, which gets applied first to <code>w</code> and <code>x</code>, then <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> in pairs.</p>
<h3>Length 5</h3>
<p>Finally, a word for working with sequences. Factor is no APL / J / K / Octave / what have you, but its array processing skills are... close... kinda.</p>
<pre><code>union
</code></pre>
<p>If you're familar with Python (like I am), then you may recognise this better as the <code>|</code> operator on <code>set</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>{ 1 2 3 } { 2 3 4 } union

--- Data stack:
{ 1 2 3 4 }
</code></pre>
<p>Removes duplicates while performing element-wise OR. Technically, the <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/word-union,sets.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>union</code></a> word is from the <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-sets.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sets</code></a> vocabulary and not the <code>sequences</code> vocab. This is because, like Python, sets are special, super-fast immutable sequences that don't allow duplicate entries.</p>
<p>Also much like Python, any sequence (byte vector, hashtable, set, etc) that implements the <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-sequence-protocol.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sequence protocol</a> (<code>__iter__</code> being the equivalent in Python) is considered fair game and supports a well-defined set (hah) of operations, so any word that works on a generic sequence A will also work on a generic set B if both have the right method dispatch.</p>
<h3>Length 6</h3>
<p>Ooh, more arrays! (Note that arrays are immutable; all operations on them yield new arrays and the old ones are GC'd. Vectors are mutable and slower, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.)</p>
<pre><code>2array
</code></pre>
<p>This is a <em>highly</em> useful word. Any guess at what it does? Here:</p>
<pre><code>IN: scratchpad 1 2 2array

--- Data stack:
{ 1 2 } 

IN: scratchpad { 3 4 } 2array

--- Data stack:
{ { 1 2 } { 3 4 } }
</code></pre>
<p>Well shucks, it takes <strong>two</strong> things off the stack and makes a new array from them. <code>1array</code>, <code>3array</code> and <code>4array</code> all do <em>exactly</em> what you'd expect, and <code>narray</code> takes an arbitrary <code>n</code> argument, to avoid messy concatenation code.</p>
<p>If I may digress yet again about naming...</p>
<p>In Java or Python, one might call this function <code>values2array</code> or <code>valuesToArray</code> or even <code>values2Array</code>. However, here in Factor-land, we have some <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-conventions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">conventions</a>.</p>
<p>Remember my spiel about identifiers? Numeric digits in names should only be used for indicating real numbers or counts of things; in particular, this means <code>2array</code> should not be read as <code>to-array</code> but as <code>two-array</code>.</p>
<p>The word which does <code>to-array</code> is called <code>&gt;array</code>. The word which turns a number to a string is <code>number&gt;string</code>, and the word which turns an object's slots to an array is <code>tuple&gt;array</code>. See a pattern? Hmm.</p>
<p>Users of <a href="http://racket-lang.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Racket</a> will feel right at home with these sorts of names, since Racket uses stuff like <code>number-&gt;string</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu147" class="pu"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-recursive_function">μ-recursive functions</a></h2>

<p>These come in many flavors, but are all essentially the same: a "functional assembly" of sorts.</p>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong>: μ-recursive functions are a Turing-complete model of computation that, unlike Lambda calculus (which is theoretically equivalent to it) has no more-or-less popular language based on it. Why? Because it manages to combine the readability of (((((Lisp)))))) with the eloquence of assembly. However, there are interpreters for several langauges that are actually flavors of μ. None of them, however, can operate with anything but unsigned integers. Pity.</p>

<p>μ, by default, supports only 2 datatypes - an unsigned integer and a function. Operators recieve and return functions, functions recieve and return unsigned integers. Simple and straightforward. That's all there is to the entire language.</p>

<p>If this recieves enough upvotes, I'll be providing snippets in <strong>RF</strong>, a small language based on μ-recursive functions created for educational purposes by a teacher at a university where some friends of mine study. It uses a flavor of μ that is a bit different from Kleene's. You can download it here: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/fnsyze4crthgl89/rf_setup.rar">http://www.mediafire.com/download/fnsyze4crthgl89/rf_setup.rar</a> (warning: entire interface is in Russian; function definitions go into the top text field, function calls go into the bottom left one, results get output to the bottom right one).</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>N</code></p>

<p>This is not runnable code, sadly. I'd need at least 5 upvotes for the first runnable RF snippet.</p>

<p>This is one of the 3 built-in functions supported by μ, the <em>successor function</em>. What does it do? Well, it simply takes one number as an input and returns this number + 1. It's also sometimes abbreviated as <code>s</code> in different μ languages.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>f()</code></p>

<p>This is the shortest possible "input" call of a μ-recursive function. It calls a 0-ary (parameterless) function f with, well, no parameters.</p>

<p>As μ is a 100% pure functional language, input is restricted to function calls, and output is restricted to function return values. All μ-based languages, including RF, provide a way to list the function calls that the program should recieve as "input". Note that this specific example won't run in RF because it requires function calls to have a <code>;</code> at the end, but it could run in another μ-based language.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>M(O)</code></p>

<p>This is one of μ's 3 operators: the minimisation operator, sometimes abbreviated as μ. Obviously, it gives the model of computation its name. This specific snippet <em>synthesizes</em> and returns a 0-ary function that always returns <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Now, this calls for a little bit of theory.</p>

<p>What does this operator do? Its workings can be written concisely as follows:</p>

<p><code>M(f(a1, a2, ... an-1, an)) called with arguments (a1, a2, ... an-1) returns the least value of an satisfying the condition f(a1, a2, ... an-1, an) == 0</code></p>

<p>It takes an n-ary function <code>f</code> as input, and <em>synthesizes</em> and returns an <code>n-1</code>-ary function (i.e. taking one argument less than the input function). </p>

<p>What does the returned function do? When called with some arguments (<code>a1, a2, ... an-1</code>), it forwards them to the input function <code>f</code>. It then finds the least possible (i.e. starting from 0) value of the last argument (<code>an</code>) which, together with the forwarded arguments, will make <code>f</code> return <code>0</code>. If <code>f</code> doesn't ever return <code>0</code> in these conditions - hello, endless loop. If it does, the synthesized function returns the value of <code>an</code> it found.</p>

<p>In the snippet above, the operator takes the 1-ary built-in function <code>O</code>, and synthesizes a <code>1 - 1 = 0</code>-ary function which finds and returns the least value of the last (and, in this case, the first) argument that would make <code>O</code> return <code>0</code>. As <code>O</code> happens to <em>always</em> return <code>0</code>, the least value of the argument would be <code>0</code>. That is what the synthesized function will return.</p>

<p>Interesting note: there are two main different notation for this, as well as the other operators. Kleene, for example, uses a notation that is the inverse of the one RF uses: in his texts, <code>an</code> is actually the first argument of the input function <code>f</code>, not the last one. However, this doesn't really matter.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>O(1);</code></p>

<p>I promised a runnable RF snippet, now, here you go. This is a RF function call "input". It calls the built-in 1-ary function <code>O</code> mentioned in the previous snippet, which always returns <code>0</code>, no matter what you pass to it. It can be really, really useful at times.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>I[1,2]</code></p>

<p>This is the <em>identity</em> function, one of the 3 built-in functions. It can take several arguments and return one of them. It is defined as <code>I[i,n](a1, a2, ... an) = ai</code></p>

<p>You can think of it as a function "template" of sorts. The square brackets can take 2 constant (nonzero unsigned integer) parameters, which determine the identity function's behaviour. The second parameter in the brackets is the number of the function's actual parameters. The first one is the index, starting from one, of the parameter that the function returns. For example, the function shown above can be read as follows: "define a function which takes 2 parameters and returns the 1st one".</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>S(N,O);</code></p>

<p>We finally reached another operator! <code>S</code> is the <em>superposition</em> operator. The piece of code above uses it to create an 1-ary function that always returns <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>This operator can be expressed as follows: <code>S(f0, f1,f2, ... fn) called with arguments (a1, a2, ... am) = f0(f1(a1, a2, ... am), f2(a1, a2, ... am), ... fn(a1, a2, ... am))</code></p>

<p>At least 2 functions should be supplied to the operator. <code>f0</code>, the first function, should have an arity equal to the number of functions passed to the operator besides it (i.e. for <code>f1,f2, ... fn</code>, the arity of <code>f0</code> should be <code>n</code>). It cannot be a 0-ary function. All other functions passed to the operator should have an equal arity (i.e. <code>f1,f2, ... fn</code> should all have the arity <code>m</code>). The synthesized function shall also have this arity (<code>m</code>).</p>

<p>The synthesized function first calls all but the first of the operator's argument functions with the arguments passed to it, and then calls the first of the operator's argument functions with the others' return values and returns its result.</p>

<p>In the snippet above, for example, when we pass an argument to the created function, it calls <code>O</code> with this argument, which returns <code>0</code>. Then it calls <code>N</code> with this return value, which returns <code>0+1 = 1</code>, so the synthesized function also returns <code>1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>zo=M(O);</code></p>

<p>This is a function definition! You can call it with <code>zo();</code>. It defines the zero-arity (parameterless) function returning <code>0</code> that I already discussed above.</p>

<p>Now we're getting to the fun part, recursion!</p>

<p><strong>Length 15 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>f=R(zo,I[2,2]);</code></p>

<p>Here <code>zo</code> is the previously defined (length 8 snippet) function.</p>

<p><code>R</code> is the <em>recursion</em> operator. The above snippet defines a recursive function that takes one input parameter, decrements it until it reaches zero, then returns zero.</p>

<p>This operator can be expressed as follows: <code>f = S(f0, f1) called with arguments (a1, a2, ...a{m-1}, am) = if am &gt; 0: f1(a1, a2, ... a{m-1}, am - 1, f(a1, a2, ... a{m-1}, am - 1)); if am == 0: f0(a1, a2, ... a{m-1})</code>.</p>

<p>This is basically good old tail recursion, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Let's see how the function above works for a parameter <code>x</code>: first, we have <code>f(x)</code>. If <code>x &gt; 0</code>, we return <code>I[2,2](x - 1, f(x - 1))</code>, which is the same as <code>f(x - 1)</code>, and so on until we reach <code>f(0)</code>, in which case we return <code>zo()</code>, i.e. <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>The recursion operator is very important in μ-recursive functions, it's the backbone of most of the logic. However, some of its uses may seem a bit strange:</p>

<p><strong>Length 16 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>de=R(zo,I[1,2]);</code></p>

<p>This function takes one parameter <code>x</code> and returns <code>x - 1</code> (decrements), if <code>x &gt; 0</code>, and returns <code>0</code> if <code>x == 0</code>. Implementing it as a counterpart to <code>N</code> is instrumental in implementing subtraction (just as <code>N</code> is necessary in addition).</p>

<p>This use of the recursion operator may be considered strange because, well, there's actually no recursion going on here at all! Consider: if <code>x &gt; 0</code>, <code>de(x) = I[1,2](x-1, de(x-1))</code>, equivalent to simply <code>x-1</code>, so the tail call <code>de(x-1)</code> doesn't even happen! And if <code>x == 0</code>, it simply returns <code>zo()</code>, or <code>0</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 18 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>de3p=S(de,I[3,3]);</code></p>

<p>I see we didn't have an example for the superposition operator already, but here we go now. This defines a function <code>de3p</code> which, using the previously-defined <code>de</code>, takes 3 parameters and decrements the last one (calling it as <code>de(I[3,3](x,y,z)) = de(z)</code>, where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> are the 3 parameters).</p>

<p>Using this function, we can now define subtraction!</p>

<p><strong>Length 19 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>sub=R(I[1,1],de3p);</code></p>

<p>The <code>sub</code> function takes two parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>x - y</code>. How it does that is quite obvious: if <code>y &gt; 0</code>, <code>sub(x,y) = de3p(x,y-1,sub(x,y-1)) = sub(x,y-1) - 1</code>. And if <code>y == 0</code>, <code>sub(x,y) = I[1,1](x) = x</code>. So, basically, the function calls itself until <code>y</code> is <code>0</code>, then takes <code>x</code> and backtracks for <code>y</code> steps, subtracting <code>1</code> from <code>x</code> on every step, resulting in <code>x - y</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 20 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>next3p=S(N,I[3,3]);</code></p>

<p>I decided to show a runnable example with every built-in function and operator; this is the last one, the built-in function <code>N</code>. This defines a function <code>next3p</code>, which takes 3 parameters and increments the last one by <code>1</code>: <code>next3p(x,y,z) = z + 1</code>. This is pretty much by analogy with the previous example and doesn't really need an explanation.</p>

<p>Now, using this example, we can do addition!</p>

<p><strong>Length 21 snippet:</strong></p>

<p><code>ad=R(I[1,1],next3p);</code></p>

<p>This defines a function <code>ad</code> which takes 2 parameters and adds them together. It works the exact same way as the subtraction function, the only difference being that <code>1</code> is added to <code>x</code> on every backtracking step.</p>

<div id="pu148" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://racket-lang.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Racket</a></h1>
<p>We have Clojure (the Java among LISPs), and Common Lisp (C), but where are Scheme (x86 asm) and <s>more</s> most importantly Racket (Python)?? :o</p>
<p>Racket is like the Python of LISPs. Common Lisp seems old (it's older than FORTRAN!), and Scheme seems boring, academic, and comes with a too-sparse standard library.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Racket is a batteries-included, industry-ready Scheme, that's fun to learn and use every day.</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>In most other LISPs, <code>()</code> is the empty list. However, Racket's syntax is minorly deviant in that <code>'()</code> is the empty list and <code>()</code> is an illegal empty application (that is, the application of nothing to nothing, which makes no sense).</p>
<h3>Length 1</h3>
<pre><code>λ
</code></pre>
<p>Other people have been counting <em>chars</em> not <em>bytes</em> so I'll use this two byte unicode glyph: <code>U+03BB GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMBDA</code>. This is synonymous with the <code>lambda</code> keyword for creating anonymous functions, which is <em>excellent</em> for golf because otherwise, you'd need to <code>(define (name args...) exprs...)</code> which is longer. (Of course, Racket isn't very golfy otherwise.)</p>
<h3>Length 2</h3>
<pre><code>#f
</code></pre>
<p>False. <code>#t</code> is for true, and so is everything that's not <code>#f</code>, much like other functional languages, and much to the dismay of every imperative programmer ever.</p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>
<pre><code>let
</code></pre>
<p>Another keyword. (Still no executable code.) This one is an integral part of any LISP; it lets us define local variables and procedures.</p>
<p>A let form looks like:</p>
<pre><code>(let ([a 1]
      [b 2])
    (displayln a)  ;; 1
    (displayln b)) ;; 2
(displayln a)      ;; error, a is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Or like:</p>
<pre><code>(let loop ([a 1])
    (displayln a)
    (loop (+ 1 a)))
</code></pre>
<p>That counts up forever, and will not cause a stack overflow because Racket is tail-recursive, like any compliant Scheme.</p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<pre><code>cadr
</code></pre>
<p>One of my favourite things about Racket is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/6MZ6I.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/6MZ6I.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>Now, <code>car</code> is the LISPism for Current Address Register, or the first item of a pair. LISP lists are singly linked lists like so:</p>
<pre><code>'(1 2 3)
;; is actually
(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 null)))
(car cdr = (car cdr = (car cdr = null))) 
;; i.e.
struct Node { int data; Node* next; };
</code></pre>
<p>Each item in the list is actually some data, and (a pointer to)another list, which is (a pointer to)another list, which is a... yeah.</p>
<p>To get the <code>cdr</code> (Current Decrement Register) of a given cons cell you use... the <code>cdr</code> function.
<br>How to get the second item in a list? <code>(car (cdr xs))</code>. Or: <code>cadr</code>.
<br>How to get the third item in a list? <code>(car (cdr (cdr xs)))</code>. Or: <code>caddr</code>.
<br>How to get the fourth item in a list? <code>(car (cdr (cdr (cdr xs))))</code>. Or: <code>cadddr</code>.</p>
<p>See where this is going? Not often are these actually used over numeric indexing, but they are  very handy.</p>

  <p>jq is like <code>sed</code> for JSON data – you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code> and friends let you play with text.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Length 0</h2>

<pre><code></code></pre>

<p>With an empty code <code>jq</code> just formats the JSON data. Often an essential first step when you need to process a huge .json file:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq '' &lt;&lt;&lt; '{"network":"StackExchange","site":["Programming Puzzles","Code Golf"]}'
{
  "network": "StackExchange",
  "site": [
    "Programming Puzzles",
    "Code Golf"
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>.
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.</code> is the simplest filter, kind of neutral: just the unaltered input (kind of <code>cat</code>). But more important, is the way to refer the current value (kind of <code>$_</code>) in an expression:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq '.*2' &lt;&lt;&lt; '3.14 42 2015'
6.28
84
4030

bash-4.3$ jq -R '{(.+"-"+.):.}' &lt;&lt;&lt; 'foo'
{
  "foo-foo": "foo"
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>

<p>No, not those <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> which delimit an array literal in JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, … (Though that syntax is also valid in <code>jq</code>.) Here <code>[]</code> is more like Ruby's splat operator, which flattens an array:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq '.|"\(.) Mississippi"' &lt;&lt;&lt; '["one","two","three"]'
"[\"one\",\"two\",\"three\"] Mississippi"

bash-4.3$ jq '.[]|"\(.) Mississippi"' &lt;&lt;&lt; '["one","two","three"]'
"one Mississippi"
"two Mississippi"
"three Mississippi"
</code></pre>

<p>The difference may be more clear if we use concatenation instead of interpolation:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq '.+" Mississippi"' &lt;&lt;&lt; '["one","two","three"]'
jq: error (at &lt;stdin&gt;:1): array (["one","two...) and string (" Mississippi") cannot be added

bash-4.3$ jq '.[]+" Mississippi"' &lt;&lt;&lt; '["one","two","three"]'
"one Mississippi"
"two Mississippi"
"three Mississippi"
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<pre><code>add
</code></pre>

<p>No, not the plain old addition. That is the same <code>+</code> in <code>jq</code> too. <code>add</code> is a builtin function which adds all elements of an array:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq 'add' &lt;&lt;&lt; '[1,3,5,7,9,11,13,17,19]'
85
</code></pre>

<p>To solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss#Anecdotes" rel="noreferrer">Gauss</a>'s task of adding numbers between 1 and 100:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq -n '[range(1;101)]|add'
5050
</code></pre>

<p>But as it is just repeated <code>+</code>, works for any data type for which <code>+</code> is defined, for example strings, which get concatenated:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq 'add' &lt;&lt;&lt; '["stack","over","flow"]'
"stackoverflow"
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<pre><code>type
</code></pre>

<p>Just tells what type the data has:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq 'type' &lt;&lt;&lt; '3.14 "3.14" [3.14] {"pi":3.14}'
"number"
"string"
"array"
"object"
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, in most cases this will be used in some kind of condition when iterating over an array's elements. For example to find out which one is not numeric:</p>

<pre><code>bash-4.3$ jq '.[]|select(type!="number")' &lt;&lt;&lt; '[0,1,2,"cukoo´s egg",4,5]'
"cukoo´s egg"
</code></pre>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<pre><code>empty

<div id="pu151" class="pu"><h1>Plurp</h1>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Plurp is a two-dimensional programming language closely related to<br>>&lt;> (fish) and Befunge. It is inspired by >&lt;>.</p>

<p><strong>1 character</strong></p>

<pre><code>&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>An infinite loop. Like in >&lt;> and Befunge, code will wrap around in Plurp.</p>

<p>In fact, any command but <code>;</code> when by itself in a program would result in an infinite loop.</p>

<p><strong>2 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>1i
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs 1 indefinitely. Any number from 0 to 9 would do pretty much the same.</p>

<p><strong>3 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>)s;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally! Something interesting! This is a cat program which outputs its input.</p>

<p><strong>4 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>1~i;
</code></pre>

<p>Demonstrates the pop (<code>~</code>) function. Although this pushes <code>1</code> to the stack, it is popped and therefore the program outputs nothing.</p>

<p><strong>5 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>'a's;
</code></pre>

<p>Prints <code>a</code>. This demonstrates the string parsing function: when an <code>'</code> is encountered, the rest of the characters are pushed to the stack as character codes until another <code>'</code> is encountered. This leads to the escape for <code>'</code> being quite costly: <code>'39&amp;'</code></p>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> used in <code>'39&amp;'</code> concatenates the top two numbers on the stack (<code>39</code> is <code>[3, 9]</code> but <code>39&amp;</code> is <code>[39]</code>).</p>

<p><strong>6 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>123|i;
</code></pre>

<p>Demonstrates the right-shift function. <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code> are pushed onto the stack, then the stack is shifted right (by one position). The output of this program is "312", as the 3 wraps around.</p>

<p><code>|</code> can also be replaced with <code>\</code> (the left-shift operator) to shift the stack one position left instead of right. This has a surprising number of applications in Plurp.</p>

<p><strong>7 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>8[42i];
</code></pre>

<p>Like >&lt;>, Plurp can create multiple stacks and run operations on each stack independent of the others.</p>

<p>There are three different kinds of stacks - additive <code>[</code>, overlap <code>(</code>, and copy additive <code>{</code>. Stacks are classified by their behaviours when opened and closed with <code>]</code> or flattened with <code>f</code>.</p>

<p>Additive stacks will be empty when open (<code>[]</code>) and will add their data to the end of the next stack when closed. <code>4[2]i;</code> outputs <code>42</code>.</p>

<p>Overlap stacks will be empty when open and will add their data to the <em>beginning</em> of the next stack when closed. <code>4(2]i;</code> outputs <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>Copy additive stacks are like additive stacks, but they open with the data of the last stack already in them. <code>4{2+]i;</code> outputs <code>442</code>.</p>

<p><strong>8 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>42&amp;"i"i;
</code></pre>

<p>Like >&lt;>, Plurp has a register (albeit only a single one). When a <code>"</code> is encountered, the interpreter checks if the register is empty. If it is, the top value on the stack is popped and pushed into the register. Otherwise, the value in the register is popped and pushed into the stack.</p>

<p>Therefore, even though there are two <code>i</code> commands, only one outputs <code>42</code> because the other is called while <code>42</code> is in the register and not the stack.</p>

<p><strong>9 characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>39&amp;'|||s;
</code></pre>

<p>A quine! From all the above snippets, you have enough information to figure out how this works. The key is that string parsing wraps around in this programming language, much like all regular commands.</p>

<p><strong>Read Me</strong></p>

<p>Currently the interpreter is broken due to the addition of an infinite-loop prevention system in Khan Academy. I'm working to fix it, and once I do I will catch up with this answer!</p>

<pre><code>0(1+~)
</code></pre>

<p>Have your program count until it reaches Infinity.. then it crashes.<br>
(On my computer takes about 2 minutes to crash :P)</p>

<p><strong>6 byte snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>u10000
</code></pre>

<p>Print 10000. What is so interesting about this?<br>
It's interesting because putting a simple <code>10000</code> will push 1 and 5 zeroes to the stack, while the <code>u</code> keyword pushes the entire number after it.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Applescript is a programming language most commonly used for automating events in the system environment and Aqua interface interactions in Mac OS X, though it can be used as a normal programming language as well. Its syntax boasts an (almost) English grammar method of writing, making it easy-to-use for programmers, beginners or otherwise.</p>

<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>

<p><code>1</code></p>

<p>Okay, it looks a little boring. </p>

<p>Basically, this is a <em>very</em> short operation. I take 1 and do nothing with it. Since AppleScript always returns the result of the final operation, it will print "1" to the console.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/piXr9.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/piXr9.gif" alt="1"></a></p>

<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>

<p><code>it</code></p>

<p>This keyword defines the current object being told to do something: if I was telling <code>Finder</code> to do something, it would return <code>Finder</code>. However, since I haven't defined anything for <code>it</code> to be tied to this is equivalent to</p>

<p><code>me</code></p>

<p>Which defines the top-level script object. So, at the end of the day, both of these 2-byte codes will return</p>

<p><code>«script»</code></p>

<p>Which is how AppleScript defines <code>it</code>self.</p>

<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>

<p>We're slowly creeping our way to show the full functionality of AppleScript...</p>

<pre>{1}</pre>

<p>This is the general array syntax in AppleScript. Arrays in AppleScript act more like ArrayLists in that they are not restricted as to what they may hold, and you can concatenate onto them at any time with <code>&amp;</code>. (note that <code>&amp;</code> is also the string concatenation symbol and in some cases may cause conflicts).</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/PmifZ.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/PmifZ.gif" alt="array"></a></p>

<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>

<pre>tell</pre>

<p>While this code by itself won't function due to the enormous verbosity AppleScript, this is the keyword that allows the "telling" of commands to an application. This unlocks enormous potential, from the automation of GUI interactions to changing System Settings with a click of a button.</p>

<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>

<pre>log""</pre>

<p>This is another benefit of AppleScript: auto-complete. AppleScript is very good at golfing (not really) due to its ability to correct code. This code will not be executed. Oh no, the code that will be executed is this:</p>

<pre>log ""</pre>

<p>It auto-fills the space for you.</p>

<p>This code, as is, will print out to the "Messages" tab in Script Editor or to STDERR through <code>osascript -e</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/Z1ion.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/Z1ion.gif" alt="log"></a></p>

<h3>Length 6 Snippet</h3>

<pre>repeat</pre>

<p>While this won't run on its own (it needs an <code>end</code> statement), this is one of the most important keywords in AppleScript - on its own, with no restrictions on how many times it will repeat, it will loop infinitely. <a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.20/20.12/RepeatLoops/index.html" rel="noreferrer">The syntax relating to repeat is immense</a>, so I won't mention it all in this snippet. It'll come back later, though.</p>

<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>

<pre>try
end</pre>

<p>Error catching in AppleScript. Piece o' cake. This may be used in instances where you are comparing possible null strings to other strings or when trying to see if <code>true &gt; 5</code>. It's also very important syntax, but used less frequently in the code golf community.</p>

<h3>Length 8 Snippet</h3>

<pre>activate</pre>

<p>Let's say you've lost the primary window of an application, or you want to start it. If you tell an application, even one that <em>isn't active</em>, to activate, it will move to the pane where it was last open (or currently open) and pull up any active windows (or start them if the application wasn't active until the point at which you told it to activate).</p>

<p>Example code that actually is relevant:</p>

<pre>tell app"Finder"to activate</pre>

<p>Runs as</p>

<pre>tell application "Finder" to activate</pre>

<p>Which makes the "Finder" application the primary application (for MacOSX users, this means that it's the application name in the top-left hand corner. It might have no active windows).</p>

<h3>Length 9 Snippet</h3>

<pre>keystroke</pre>

<p>This is a command that's typically specific for the application 'System Events' - basically, it replicates the user of typing in a character.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/F9gzK.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/F9gzK.gif" alt="keystroke"></a></p>

<h3>Length 10 Snippet</h3>

<pre>set x to 1</pre>

<p><em>Finally</em>.</p>

<p>This is how you make variables in AppleScript. Due to its verbosity, many answers for languages like CJam or Pyth will be shorter than <em>just the variable declaration</em>. This is why AppleScript will almost <em>never</em> win at golfing.</p>

<p>Still, though. The fact that it's also pseudocode is nice.</p>

<h3>Length 11 Snippet</h3>

<pre>if 1&lt;=1
end</pre>

<p>A simple if statement.</p>

<p>This will execute as</p>

<pre>if 1 ≤ 1
end if</pre>

<p>Thanks to AppleScript autocorrection and bonus(!) supported characters. This is the most basic (and most concise!) syntax for if statements in AppleScript.</p>

<p>Note: This is actually shorter than <code>if &lt;conditional&gt; then</code>, the one-line way to do it.</p>

<p>Second note: Because of the <em>extreme</em> verbosity of AppleScript, the "correct" way to do this is with <code>less than or equal to</code>, but it will support &lt;= or ≤ anyways.</p>

<h3>Length 12 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>current date

<p>Wonder what this one does...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/bTTPM.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/bTTPM.gif" alt="current date"></a></p>

<h3>Length 13 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>the clipboard
</code></pre>

<p>You can gather the contents of the clipboard fairly simply with this command; when called anywhere, it will return the value of what's held currently in the clipboard. It's brother, <code>set the clipboard to</code>, does exactly as it sounds.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/ELw1o.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ELw1o.gif" alt="clipboard"></a></p>

<h3>Length 14 Snippet</h3>

<p>You know a language is verbose when the first method of input through scripting is 32 bytes long.</p>

<pre><code>clipboard info
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not even sure what this one is... The documentation about it simply says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns information about the clipboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>

<p>This is a result for a clipboard that has been set to <code>""</code> with the command <code>set the clipboard to ""</code></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/FNIrS.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/FNIrS.gif" alt="clipboard2"></a></p>

<h3>Length 15 Snippet</h3>

<p>Who knew AppleScript was so sassy?</p>

<pre><code>summarize string

<p>I honestly have no clue what the point of this command is. When called on datatypes, though, it does some funny things.</p>

</div>
<div id="pu155" class="pu"><h1>Smalltalk</h1>

<p><a href="https://smalltalkrenaissance.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Smalltalk</a> has five keywords. The entire spec fits on a single sheet of paper. </p>

<p>Smalltalk is a small language ;-), with only a minimum number of builtin semantic features - basically the language only defines the syntax for how messages are sent to objects (that's what others would name "virtual function calling").</p>

<p>However, it comes with a big class library. This is open for inspection and extension, and includes everything from numeric operations to UI frameworks to compilers, editors, debuggers and class browsers. </p>

<p>Smalltalk is pure object oriented, with no exceptions. Everything down to integers, characters, stack frames, methods and closures is represented as an instance of a class. This includes classes themself, which are instances of a metaclass. </p>

<p>Every class can be extended, modified, subclassed or reinherited at execution time. </p>

<p>Every Smalltalk dialect comes with a powerful IDE, which makes heavy use of the above dynamic possibilities. For example, it is possible to change code in the debugger and proceed execution without any limitation. Programs are developed inside the IDE - that means that your application classes and objects live in the same world. There is no required separation between the IDE objects and the application objects, and each can make use of the other. of course, you can also extent the IDE itself, while you are living in it.</p>

<p>For programmers, the combination of powerful IDE and high dynamics due to the very late binding, make this a great environment for rapid development.</p>

<h1>Length 1</h1>

<p>Numbers evaluate to themselves - numbers are objects:</p>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 2</h1>

<p>Character literals (constants) are preceeded by dollar signs:</p>

<pre><code>$1
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 3</h1>

<p>Strings are in single quotes, like in SQL:</p>

<pre><code>'1'
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 4</h1>

<p>Literal arrays are stored in hash &amp; parenthesis.  These are created when a method is compiled, not at runtime, so it can improve performance:</p>

<pre><code>#(1)
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 5</h1>

<p>Mixed mode arithmetic is done transparently. Values are coerced automatically as required:</p>

<pre><code>1+2.0
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 6</h1>

<p>Blocks are anonymous functions. They can access the variables in their static scope. Blocks can outlive the dynamic scope in which they were created (i.e. they are Closures). Here is a simple block which returns its argument:</p>

<pre><code>[:a|a]
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 7</h1>

<p>Smalltalk has builtin support for Fractional numbers. These compute exact values and thus avoid the usual floating-point rounding errors. Multiplying 1/3 by 9 gives an exact integer 3, not 2.9999999 as in some other languages:</p>

<pre><code>(1/3)*9
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 8</h1>

<p>Scaled Decimal (FixedPoint) numbers are perfect for monetary values. They will print out with the specified number of fractional digits. Technically, they are fractions with a power-of-10 denominator. The following is a fixedpoint constant which always prints itself with 2 digits after the decimal point: </p>

<pre><code>105.12s2
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 9</h1>

<p>In Smalltalk, assignment is done with ":=". The "Value comparison" operator is "=", as opposed to the "Identity comparison", which is "==". The following will assign a boolean true or false to b, depending on the numerical value of x (i.e. works for x being of ANY numeric type, such as Float, Int, FixedPoint etc.) </p>

<pre><code>b:=(x=10)
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 10</h1>

<p>Intervals are collections, and as such can be used whereever other indexable collections can be used. For example, they can be enumerated with the "do:" messsage, passing a block like shown above; i.e. "(1 to:10) do:[:x |...]". The following creates an Interval representing the integer numbers from 1 to 10. </p>

<pre><code>(1 to:10) 
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 11</h1>

<p>In Smalltalk, statements are separated by a period - just like in English. I added a space, to get 11 characters:</p>

<pre><code>a:=0. b:=1.
</code></pre>

<h1>Length 12</h1>

<p>There's no real syntax for method definitions. You can create methods dynamically, but that takes a lot more chars to demonstrate. This is what you could see as a method definition in a class browser:</p>

<pre><code>+ s
^self, s
</code></pre>

<p>This is a binary method called "+", that takes an argument "s". And it returns (^) the concatenation of the receiver with the argument.<br/>
Define it in class String to instantly uglify the language!</p>

<h1>Length 13</h1>

<p>This used to be <code>100 factorial</code>, but that impresses nobody...</p>

<pre><code>999 factorial
</code></pre>

<p>Open a browser, type it in and <code>print it</code> (alt p in Squeak/Pharo), don't be scared. I wonder if it's right though? Probably is...</p>

<p>Just to be sure:</p>

<pre><code>999 factorial / 998 factorial
</code></pre>

  <p> Squeak says it's 999</p>

<div id="pu156" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/DenkerAffe/IPOS" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IPOS</a></h1>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>IPOS is a stack-based golfing-language for string processing. An IPOS program places it's input on the stack at the start and prints the concatenated stack contents at the end. This has the nice side-effect that a zero byte IPOS program is equivalent to a basic cat-program.</p>
<h3>Length 1</h3>
<pre><code>L
</code></pre>
<p>IPOS has a set of <a href="https://github.com/DenkerAffe/IPOS/wiki/Variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">predefined variables</a>. This program pushes the value of the variable <code>L</code> to the stack which is the alphabet in lowercase letters. Remember that any input string gets placed on the stack initially. So this program appends the lowercase alphabet to the input and prints it.</p>
<h3>Length 2</h3>
<pre><code>SA
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes a string with space-separated words and sorts them in ascening order. For example the input <code>Programming Puzzles &amp; Code Golf</code> yields the result <code>&amp; Code Golf Programming</code>.</p>
<p><strong>How this works</strong><br />
The input string is already placed at the stack. We push a space (variable <code>S</code>) to the stack and apply the command <code>A</code> which splits the input on spaces, sorts the resulting substrings in ascending order and joins the result back on spaces.</p>
<h3>Length 3</h3>
<pre><code>'A=
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned in the first program, IPOS has a set of predefined variables. If you want to define a custom variable, you can do that with the <code>=</code> command. It creates a new variable with the name given in the top stack item and assigns the value given by the stack item below that.</p>
<p>Variable names can only be one character long. Also they overwrite the original meaning of this character which means that we can no longer use <code>A</code> for sorting as we did in the program with length 2.</p>
<p>So this program simply takes the input and saves it in a variable named <code>A</code>. Since you usually need this value right away, <code>=</code> also leaves the assigned value on the stack, so the output of this program is identical to the input.</p>
<h3>Length 4</h3>
<pre><code>P!r%
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes an input string and reverses each substring between dots. So the input <code>abc.def.ghij</code> yields <code>jihg.fed.cba</code>.</p>
<p>Straight to the code breakdown this time:</p>
<pre>
P!r%

P      # Push a dot '.', one of the predefined variables.
 !r    # Push a command that reverses a string
   %   # Split the input on dots, apply the reverse command to every substring 
       # and join the resulting substring back on dots.
</pre>
<p>This shows one of the commands for functional programming. Those make use of command objects that are basically strings which get treated as IPOS code. They can be created like normal strings, but instead of quotes, we use backticks for them. To create a command object with only one command we can just put a <code>!</code> before it.</p>
<h3>Length 5</h3>
<pre><code>S'+Re
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes a string of space seperated numbers and outputs their sum. Pretty simple task, but the way it does that is quite interesting.</p>
<p>IPOS does not have any builtins for math operations besides simple incrementing and decrementing. It is still a language for string processing, so I didn't see a reason to include those. However, we can make use of the eval command <code>e</code> to do some basic math. This command takes a string and performs the numeric calculations in it using Python syntax.</p>
<p>You might already suspect where this is going. The above program simply replaces spaces with pluses by pushing a space and a plus character and applying the replace command <code>R</code> to them and the input. The resulting string then gets evaluated by <code>e</code> which yields the expected result.</p>
<h3>Length 6</h3>
<pre><code>S`2&lt;`%
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes a string of space separated words and removes all but the first two characters from them.<br />
We are using <code>%</code> again here which splits the input on a given character (here space), applies a set of commands to each part and joins the parts back. As mentioned above, command objects can be created just like a string, but are enclosed in backticks. The command we are applying to each part here is <code>2&lt;</code> which takes the first two characters of a string and discards the rest.</p>
<h3>Length 7</h3>
<pre><code>SC/eCPj
</code></pre>
<p>This program takes a string followed by a space and a number, splits the string into that many pieces and joins the result back on dots.</p>
<pre>
SC       # Split input on spaces
  /      # Swap the two top stack items so the number is on top
   e     # Convert the number into an integer
    C    # Split the string into pieces and pushe the substrings to the stack
     Pj  # Join the whole stack on dots

<pre><code>1¶:+!
</code></pre>
<p>This uses an intersting feature: default stack pop override! <code>¶</code> pops <code>n</code> and sets <code>n</code> to the default value when popping from an empty stack. (This is <code>0</code> by default.) What this code does is initially lay down a <code>1</code>, sets that as a default pop, <code>:</code> duplicates value (getting default pop) and adds it with the default pop, leaving twice the default pop on the stack. <code>!</code> skips the <code>1</code> instruction, and <code>¶</code> sets the default pop to twice what it was.</p>
<h2>4-vote</h2>
<pre><code>is~o
</code></pre>
<p>This is a cat program. It takes input (<code>i</code>), <code>s</code> jumps if the byte != -1, and <code>o</code> outputs. When reading EOF for input, <code>-1</code> is put on the stack, and the program terminates.</p>

<div id="pu158" class="pu"><h2><a href="http://tossha.com/rpl/" rel="noreferrer">RPL (Redstone Programming Language)</a> [and Minecraft]</h2>
<p>This is a big stretch on whether or not we can consider this a real programming language or not, but we will try anyway. And, as these two &quot;languages&quot; are practically the same, I will combine them, sometimes post snippets in &quot;Minecraft&quot; language (redstone, etc) and sometimes in RPL. Also, since many snippets will be in Minecraft, I will post links to the pictures rather than the pictures themselves to save space. Additionally, all snippets will be of programming concepts in Minecraft, not general redstone (i.e. no redstone doors will appear). Characters will be counted in bytes (in RPL) or as according to <a href="http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/7397/36670">this</a> (in Minecraft).</p>
<h3>Factoid:</h3>
<p>RPL is a programming language by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvH7xdcFYPpCYXHBX2TzUmA" rel="noreferrer">Tossha the Inventor</a> that converts code into Minecraft redstone and command blocks. It can do input and output, loops, integer manipulation, trig functions, roots, and more.</p>
<h3>Length 1:</h3>
<p>A button (1 byte) is the simplest form of input in Minecraft. It also can start or stop a &quot;program&quot;. Similarly, a lever (also 1 byte) is another form of input, and can also be used to both start and stop the program as it has an &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; state. Something to remember is that Minecraft is literally a 3D programming language, so where the button/lever is place in the program can make a huge difference.</p>
<h3>Length 2:</h3>
<p>A button attached to a redstone lamp is pretty much your <em>very basic</em> cat program. It takes the input (with a button or lever, either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> (<code>off</code> or <code>on</code>)) and outputs it in the form as light from the lamp as either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> (<code>off</code> or <code>on</code>).</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/IXcAh.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/IXcAh.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<h2>Length 3:</h2>
<p>As seen below, this one of the shortest source-code modifying programs (as you can modify the source at runtime with Minecraft!). Now, this specific one really has no use, but the concept can be combined with others to create some awesome programs (as to come with more upvotes). When run, this program removes its source of input, and makes itself unable to be run again.
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/wPo9u.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/wPo9u.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<h2>Length 4</h2>
<p>This &quot;snippet&quot; actually shows two concepts: delay, and the NOT gate. Delay is made using certain redstone elements that have a <em>redstone-tick</em> delay. A redstone-tick is equal to one-tenth of a second. Different redstone components have different delays: a torch has a 1rt delay (1 redstone-tick), a comparator has a 1rt delay, a repeater can have a 1, 2, 3, or 4rt delay, depending on how it is set up. In this example, the redstone repeater is set to a 4rt delay.</p>
<p>Next is the NOT gate. The NOT gate takes an input an inverts it. So in this set up, the output will be on if the input is off, and the output will be off if the input is on.</p>
<h2>Length 5</h2>
<p>The OR gate is very easy to accomplish in Minecraft. Two inputs are connected to the same output. That is it. No funny trickery or anything, it's pretty simple.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/GYVrr.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/GYVrr.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<h2>Length 6</h2>
<p>Here is a tip for compacting your &quot;code&quot;. If you know the signal strength of two inputs are small enough to not interfere with the corresponding outputs, you can wire the redstone right nect to each other. In the example below, there is a simple hopper timer, which transfers items back and forth in about 0.5s in each hopper, conncected to comparators that output a signal strength of 1. This means that the two ouputs will not interfere with each other. In the example, the lamps are there for demonstration purposes only and don't count towards the total block count.</p>

<h3>22</h3>

<pre><code>reduce [1 + 2 * 3 red]
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/reduce.html" rel="nofollow"><code>reduce</code></a> function  <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/guide/code-eval.html" rel="nofollow">evaluates</a> multiple expressions and returns a block of results.  There are two <em>expressions</em> in the above block so it returns a block with two values: <code>[9 255.0.0]</code></p>

<p>NB. For the eagled eyed who were expecting <code>7</code> from <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> this is because Rebol has no operator precedence and simply <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/concepts/math-precedence.html" rel="nofollow">evaluates operators from left to right</a>.  Use parenthesis to enforce precedence, for eg. <code>1 + (2 * 3)</code> would return <code>7</code>.</p>

<h3>21</h3>

<pre><code>compose [blue (blue)]
</code></pre>

<p>This returns a block with <code>[blue 0.0.255]</code> </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/compose.html" rel="nofollow"><code>compose</code></a> function evaluates any code found in parenthesis (<a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/paren.html" rel="nofollow">paren! datatype</a>) but leaves everything else untouched.</p>

<h3>20</h3>

<pre><code>red + blue = magenta
</code></pre>

<p>This returns <code>true</code> because Rebol supports <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/tuple.html#section-4" rel="nofollow">tuple arithmetic</a>.</p>

<h3>19</h3>

<pre><code>type? baz@email.com
</code></pre>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/type-q.html" rel="nofollow"><code>type?</code></a> to find the value's datatype.  This example returns <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/email.html" rel="nofollow"><code>email!</code></a></p>

<p>NB. As you can see from the examples so far, Rebol comes with a lot of handy <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes.html" rel="nofollow"><code>datatypes</code></a></p>

<h3>18</h3>

<pre><code>$0.1 + $0.2 = $0.3
</code></pre>

<p>The above returns <code>true</code> because these are <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/money.html" rel="nofollow"><code>money!</code></a> datatypes. So ideal for <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/rebol.net/blob/master/wikipedia/Money.wiki" rel="nofollow">high precision arithmetic</a> <s><a href="http://www.rebol.net/wiki/Money" rel="nofollow">original link down at moment</a></s> .</p>

<h3>17</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="red"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/tag.html" rel="nofollow"><code>tag!</code></a> datatype.</p>

<h3>16</h3>

<pre><code>24:00 - now/time
</code></pre>

<p>This returns how long there is left in the day (in HH:MM:SS - a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/time.html" rel="nofollow"><code>time!</code></a> datatype).</p>

<p>NB. This code shows the first example of a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/refinement.html" rel="nofollow"><code>refinement!</code></a> in Rebol.  With refinements you can modify the functions behaviour including adding extra arguments.  By itself  <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/now.html" rel="nofollow"><code>now</code></a> would return the current date and time (<code>date!</code>).  The <code>/time</code> refinement causes <code>now</code> to return the time only (<code>time!</code>).</p>

<h3>15</h3>

<pre><code>{"a" {foo} "c"}
</code></pre>

<p>This is one way to represent a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/string.html" rel="nofollow"><code>string!</code></a> datatype in Rebol.   Another way to express this would look like this <code>"^"a^" {foo} ^"c^""</code> which isn't as visually appealing! </p>

<p>NB. Using braces over double quotes allows spanning of multiple lines and also nested <code>{}</code>.  The <code>^</code> is used to escape the <em>quoting</em> delimiter. So  <code>{closing brace is ^} opening brace is ^{}</code> would be how an unbalanced <code>{}</code> would look.</p>

<h3>14</h3>

<pre><code>read %file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This will read in the entire contents of <code>file.txt</code> into memory.  Any word prefixed with <code>%</code> is a platform-independent <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/file.html" rel="nofollow"><code>file!</code></a> datatype.</p>

<p>NB. <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/read.html" rel="nofollow"><code>read</code></a> can also suck content down from other sources, eg. <code>read http://www.rebol.com</code> (this is a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/url.html" rel="nofollow"><code>url!</code></a> datatype).</p>

<h3>13</h3>

<pre><code>100'000'000.0
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same as <code>100000000.0</code>.  Single quotes (<code>'</code>) are allowed to split up numbers for readability. </p>

<p>NB. Commas can also be used to mark decimal places, eg. <code>100'000'000,0</code> is a valid <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/decimal.html" rel="nofollow"><code>decimal!</code></a> datatype.</p>

<h3>12</h3>

<pre><code>something: 1
</code></pre>

<p>This sets the word <code>something</code> to represent the value 1.</p>

<p>NB. Rebol is quite liberal in what can be used for a word as long as it doesn't clash with any known datatype.  For e.g. another valid 12 length answer would be <code>a-.+!&amp;'*?: 1</code></p>

<h3>11</h3>

<pre><code>12-Dec-2012
</code></pre>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/date.html" rel="nofollow"><code>date!</code></a> datatype.  </p>

<h3>10</h3>

<pre><code>to-hex red
</code></pre>

<p>Functions in Rebol have fixed arity.  The <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/to-hex.html" rel="nofollow"><code>to-hex</code></a> function expects one argument and returns a hex <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/issue.html" rel="nofollow"><code>issue!</code></a> datatype. </p>

<p>NB. The example given returns <code>#FF0000</code> which is ideal for CSS colours.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<pre><code>#{FF0000}
</code></pre>

<p>This is hex (base-16) literal notation.  Other bases for this <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/binary.html" rel="nofollow"><code>binary!</code></a> datatype are also available.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<pre><code>12:15:33
</code></pre>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/time.html" rel="nofollow"><code>time!</code></a> datatype (HH:MM:SS).</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<pre><code>newline
</code></pre>

<p>Gives Rebol's internal (platform-independent) newline character. Written as a character literal, this would be <code>#"^/"</code> -- the line-feed character. </p>

<p>NB. The <code>#</code> prefix here denotes a single character and not a string (ie. a series of characters like <code>"foobar"</code>).  And the <code>^/</code> is Rebol way of representing the <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/char.html" rel="nofollow">control code</a> for LF.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<pre><code>speed?
</code></pre>

<p>Returns simplistic (and approximate) speed benchmarks for evaluation, CPU, memory &amp; file IO.  Handy for comparing the speed of your Rebol on different machines.</p>

<p>NB. General convention is that postfixing word with <code>?</code> is used to signify <em>what's</em> / <em>what is its</em>.   For eg. <code>length? list</code> or <code>type? word</code></p>

<h3>5</h3>

<pre><code>1 = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Equality test.  </p>

<p>The operator <code>=</code> is infix synonym for <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/equal-q.html" rel="nofollow"><code>equal?</code></a>.  <code>==</code> for <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/functions/strict-equal-q.html" rel="nofollow"><code>strict-equal?</code></a>.</p>

<p>NB. Spaces are important because <code>1=1</code> would be recognised as a word (and an invalid word at that).</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<pre><code>why?
</code></pre>

<p>Explains the last error (that occurred) in more detail. It does this by opening your web-browser on the necessary webpage that documents the error.</p>

<p>For eg. <code>foobar</code> would produce the error <code>** Script error: foobar has no value</code>.  Typing
<code>why?</code> next will open browser window pointing at <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/errors/script-no-value.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/errors/script-no-value.html</a>  </p>

<p>NB.  This is the first function call example given. <code>why?</code> is a word which points to a defined function (<code>source why?</code> for details). When Rebol interpreter hits a word like this it invokes the function.  If the function requires any arguments then Rebol evaluates the necessary words that follow and passes them to the function.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<pre><code>red
</code></pre>

<p>This returns a <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/datatypes/tuple.html" rel="nofollow"><code>tuple</code></a> which in this case is a tuple of RGB values (for the colour red!).</p>

<p>NB. And <code>red</code> is not the only colour defined in Rebol - <a href="http://rebol2.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/color-names.html" rel="nofollow">http://rebol2.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/color-names.html</a></p>

<p>BTW. Red also happens to be the name for an alternative version of Rebol - <a href="http://www.red-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.red-lang.org/</a></p>

<h3>2</h3>

<pre><code>no
</code></pre>

<p>Rebol comes with a few synonyms for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>... <code>yes no on off</code></p>

<p>NB. These are all just words in the Rebol lexicon (including <code>true</code> &amp; <code>false</code>) so all can be redefined.  So if you peek underneath you'll find the truth is actually <code>#[true]</code> (literally!).</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<pre><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything after a semicolon to end of the line is ignored by the Rebol interpreter.</p>

<p>NB. Space(s) are important to Rebol because it interprets the <em>words</em> it sees.   But <code>;</code> is one of those exceptions where it cuts across this.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.rebol.com/" rel="nofollow">Rebol</a> is a dynamic programming language designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sassenrath" rel="nofollow">Carl Sassenrath</a> with data exchange in mind.  NB. Douglas Crockford has cited Rebol for being an influence on JSON design.</p>

<p>It had been proprietary but Rebol 3 was finally <a href="https://github.com/rebol/rebol" rel="nofollow">opensourced</a> on 12-12-2012 just before the world ended :) (according to the Mayan calendar!)</p>
</div>
<div id="pu160" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Beeswax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">beeswax</a></h1>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong>:</p>

<p>beeswax is a self-modifying 2D esoteric programming language created by Manuel Lohmann, based on a 2-dimensional hexagonal grid. Every cell in a beeswax program (the honeycomb) has 6 neighbors.</p>

<pre><code>  2 — 1
 / \ / \
3 — β — 0
 \ / \ /
  4 — 5
</code></pre>

<p>Actual layout:</p>

<pre><code>21
3β0
 45
</code></pre>

<p>Instruction pointers (called bees) travel around on the honeycomb. Bees can pick up values from any location on the honeycomb, or drop values on it, potentially changing its size and content. Every bee carries a stack (local stack/lstack), with a fixed length of 3. Bees can interact with a global stack (gstack) of unlimited length that’s accessible by all bees. The gstack only allows basic stack operations like rotating up, down (similar to how Piet handles the stack) and pushing and popping values on or off the stack. All arithmetic or bitwise manipulation of data has to be done by bees.
All values in beeswax are unsigned 64-bit integers.</p>

<p>Another 12 bytes long example. This calculates and outputs the fibonacci sequence, part of my solution to the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/67683/39407">Fibonacci function or sequence</a> challenge.</p>

<p>Finally a program doing something more useful again.</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<pre><code>          lstack     output
      *   [0 0 0]•            create bee
     {                 0      output lstack 1st as integer to STDOUT
    P     [0 0 1]•            increment lstack 1st
   &lt;                      (1) redirect to left
  N                   \n      output newline to STDOUT
 {                     1      output lstack 1st as integer to STDOUT
p                             redirect to lower left
&gt;~        [0 1 0]•            redirect to right, flip lstack 1st and 2nd
  +d      [0 1 1]•            lstack 1st=1st+2nd, redirect to upper right
   &lt;                          redirect to left, loop back to (1)
  N                   \n      utput newline to STDOUT
 {                     1
p
&gt;~        [0 1 1]•
  +d      [0 1 2]•
   &lt;
  N                   \n
 {                     2
p
&gt;~+d      [0 2 3]•
  N&lt;                  \n
p{                     3
&gt;~+d      [0 3 5]•
  N&lt;                  \n
p{                     5
...
...
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs the fibonacci sequence, but only up to the 93rd element, after which 64bit-wraparound causes the sequence to produce wrong values:</p>

<pre><code>       ...
4660046610375530309
7540113804746346429
12200160415121876738   ← 93rd Fibonacci number, last correct value
1293530146158671551    ← 1st. case of 64-bit overflow/wraparound
13493690561280548289
       ...
</code></pre>

<p>Implementing a longer word length is possible, of course. Maybe I can implement such a fibonacci sequence program in one of the next examples.</p>

<p><strong>Length 12 snippet</strong></p>

<p>This is my contribution to the <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/76415/39407">Code that executes only once challenge</a>.
You have to save this program in a file named <code>!</code>.
This program does not add any new fancy ideas—it is just a slightly modified realization of the idea shown in snippet length 10.</p>

<pre><code>_8F+++P]f1Fw
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation</p>

<pre><code>                  lstack                        gstack
_8F+++P        [0x08,0x08,0x21]•
       ]       [0x08,0x08,0x2100000000000000]•                        rotate bits of lstack 1st by lstack 2nd steps to the right
        f1     [0x08,0x08,0x01]•               [0x2100000000000000]•  push lstack 1st on gstack, set lstack 1st to 1
          Fw   [0x01,0x01,0x01]•                                      write file named "!" (Char(0x21)) with content 0x00 (1 byte).
</code></pre>

<p>So, during execution the program overwrites its own file, so it can’t be executed again.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11 snippet</strong> (clear screen using ANSI escape sequence)</p>

<pre><code>_3F..}`[2J`
</code></pre>

<p>This is my beeswax example for the task <em>Terminal control—Clear the sreen</em> on rosettacode, which can be found <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Terminal_control/Clear_the_screen#beeswax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>• marks top of stack

<p>This program uses the ANSI escape sequence <code>ESC[2J</code>, as shown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.
<code>27</code> is the ASCII code for the control character <code>ESC</code>, <code>[2J</code> is the rest of the ANSI escape sequence to clear the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Length 10 snippet</strong> (introducing the file write instruction)</p>

<p>At instruction <code>w</code> lstack is <code>[1,1,1]•</code>. This means, lstack 1st bytes (1 byte) of gstack are used for the file name, and lstack 2nd bytes (1 byte) are used for the file content. The first byte of gstack is <code>0x5a</code>, or <code>90</code> in decimal. This is the ASCII code for the character <code>Z</code>. The next byte is <code>0x00</code>,which is the file content.
So, this program creates a file <code>Z</code> with the content <code>0x00</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 snippet II</strong> (truth machine, introducing all conditional operators)</p>

<p>My solution to the challenge <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/68730/39407">Implement a Truth Machine</a>. My full explanation can be found there.</p>

<pre><code> _T&gt; "{'j
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not a real showcase without a truth machine, right? ;)
This example also showcases two different conditional jump instructions that are working hand in hand in their functionality.</p>

<p>If lstack is <code>[0,0,0]•</code> (the user entered <code>0</code>) then the bee only visits the instructions:</p>

<pre><code>_T&gt; "{'
</code></pre>

<p>and jumps outside the honeycomb, which terminates the program after printing out one <code>0</code> to STDOUT.</p>

<p>If lstack is <code>[0,0,1]•</code> (the user enters <code>1</code>) then the case gets more interesting:</p>

<pre><code>_T&gt; " 'j'{"&gt; " 'j'{"&gt; " 'j'{"&gt;....
</code></pre>

<p>which lets the program output an infinite stream of <code>1</code>s to STDOUT.
Instruction <code>j</code> reflects the direction of the IP horizontally (see the list at the length 4 snippet) to run the check over and over again.</p>

<p>Beeswax has 4 conditional and one unconditional “skip next” instructions:</p>

<p><code>'</code>  skip next instruction if <code>lstack 1st value = 0</code>.</p>

<p><code>"</code>  skip next instruction if <code>lstack 1st value &gt; 0</code>.</p>

<p><code>K</code>  skip next instruction if <code>lstack 1st value = 2nd value</code>.</p>

<p><code>L</code>  skip next instruction if <code>lstack 1st value &gt; 2nd value</code>.</p>

<p><code>Q</code>  skip next instruction unconditionally.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 snippet</strong> (introducing absolute addressing)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<pre><code>          lstack
_         [0,0,0]•        create bee
 4        [0,0,4]•        lstack 1st=4
  F       [4,4,4]•        lstack=lstack 1st
   (      [4,4,64]•       1st=1st&lt;&lt;2nd (arithmetic shift left)
    @     [64,4,4]•       flip lstack 1st/3rd
     0    [64,4,0]•       lstack 1st=0
      @   [0,4,64]•       flip back
       D                  drop lstack 1st at row,column = lstack 2nd,3rd
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code> _4F(@0@D


@
</code></pre>

<p>The 3 instructions <code>D</code>(drop value at cell), <code>G</code>(get value from cell) and <code>J</code>(jump to cell) use absolute addressing. Beeswax programs use 1-indexed coordinates, the y coordinate pointing “downwards”, with the origin at the upper left corner of the honeycomb.
Instruction <code>D</code> has the ability to change the size of the honeycomb by dropping values outside the current honeycomb area. Growth in positive direction (down and right) is only limited by the <code>UInt64</code> number range, growth in negative direction is only possible if values get dropped to the coordinate <code>(0,n)</code>, <code>(n,0)</code> or <code>(0,0)</code>.
The example above drops the value <code>64</code> (ASCII for <code>@</code>) at <code>(row,column)=(4,0)</code>
Column <code>0</code> is the (imaginary) column right at the left border of the honeycomb. If the honeycomb grows in negative direction, then the origin of the new honeycomb gets reset to the new upper left corner. That means, in the example above, the new origin <code>(1,1)</code> changes to the coordinate left of the <code>_</code>. Negative growth is only possible in steps of 1 because unlike the relative addressing instructions, <code>D</code> does not recognize 2’s complements as negative numbers.</p>

<p>A little word of advice: Don’t try to drop values at too high addresses because you’ll run out of memory very quickly. An area of roughly 11,600x11,600 cells already needs at least 1 GB of memory (if the cells only contain 8-bit values and no multibyte characters).</p>

<p><strong>length 7 snippet</strong> (introducing relative addressing)</p>

<pre><code>_T";@Z}
</code></pre>

<p>The program above is not really useful, but it demonstrates how the code manipulation instructions that address cells locally work in beeswax.
There are two of these instructions that address cells locally: <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code>.
Instruction <code>Y</code> drops values to a cell that’s addressed relative to the position of <code>Y</code> in the program.
Instruction <code>Z</code> picks up a value from a cell that’s addressed relative to the position of the <code>Z</code> instruction. As all values in beeswax are unsigned 64 bit integers, there is a problem. You can’t address any cells at relative addresses lower than <code>(row,column)=(0,0)</code>. But bees aren’t stupid, so they figured out how to solve that problem by using the two’s complement of the addresses for the cells in question, meaning cells located at the left or below (the coordinate system of the honeycomb is flipped upside down). The two’s complement of a 64 bit integer <code>n</code> is simply <code>2^64-n</code>.</p>

<p>The addressing works identical for instruction <code>Y</code>.</p>

<p>At instruction <code>Z</code> in the example, relative address</p>

<p><code>(0,0)</code> is the cell of the instruction itself, returning the value 90, the ASCII value of <code>Z</code>.</p>

<p><code>(0,1)</code> returns 125, the ASCII value of  <code>}</code></p>

<p><code>(0,2)</code> returns 0, the default return value if the relative address is outside the honeycomb.</p>

<p><code>(0,-1)</code> becomes <code>(0,18446744073709551615)</code> and returns <code>64</code>, the ASCII value for <code>@</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Z picks up values at the relative address <code>lstack[column,row,-]•</code> and puts the value that’s found at that address on top of the lstack.</p>

<p>Program flow:</p>

<pre><code>_                            create bee
 T                           read in integer from STDIN (enter column of character to be read)
  "                          skip next instruction if lstack 1st&gt;0
   ;                         terminate program (if user entered 0)
    @                        flip lstack 1st and 3rd values
     Z                       pick up value from cell at lstack[column,row,-]3
      }                      output lstack 1st as char to STDOUT

<p>Introducing new instructions: <code>T</code> and <code>~</code></p>

<p>Explanation:
(<code>•</code> marks top of stack)</p>

<pre><code>        lstack

*T      [0,0,a]•     Create bee. Get integer from STDIN, store as lstack 1st value.
  ~     [0,a,0]•     Flip lstack 1st and 2nd values.
   T    [0,a,b]•     Get integer from STDIN, store as lstack 1st value.
    +   [0,a,a+b]•   lstack 1st = lstack 1st + lstack 2nd.
     {  [0,a,a+b]•   Output lstack 1st to STDOUT
</code></pre>

<p>This program adds two positive integers given by the user.</p>

<p>There are 4 I/O operators that interact only with the lstack:</p>

<p><code>T</code> Get integer value from STDIN, store as lstack top value.</p>

<p><code>,</code> Get character from STDIN, store its value as lstack top value.</p>

<p><code>{</code> Output lstack top value as integer to STDOUT.</p>

<p><code>}</code> Output lstack top value as Character to STDOUT.</p>

<p>Just for convenience, during program execution <code>T</code> and <code>,</code> give different output for the input request, so the user knows what is wanted by the program.</p>

<p><code>T</code> outputs an <code>i</code> to remind the user that an integer is requested.
<code>,</code> outputs a <code>c</code> to remind the user that a character is requested.</p>

<p>The program above looks like this during execution:</p>

<pre><code>_9FB{
</code></pre>

<p>This program ouputs <code>387420489</code> to STDOUT, which is the result of <code>9^9</code>.</p>

<p>Explanation (<code>•</code> marks top of stack):</p>

<pre><code>step          lstack

_9          [0,0,9]•         Create bee, set lstack top value to 9.
  F         [9,9,9]•         Set all lstack values to the first value. 
   B        [9,9,387420489]• lstack top = top^2nd.
    {       [9,9,387420489]• output lstack top to STDOUT.
</code></pre>

<p>In beeswax, the numbers <code>0...9</code> set the top of lstack to the appropriate integer value.</p>

<p><code>F</code> sets all lstack values equal to the topmost value.
The other operator setting all lstack values to the same value is <code>z</code> (not used here), which sets all lstack values to <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>This is the first example that uses an arithmetic operator, <code>B</code>, which raises lstack 1st to the power of lstack 2nd value.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong></p>

<p>The shortest valid beeswax program contains at least 1 of 4 instructions to create bees at the start of the program.</p>

<p>A program only containing one of these instructions does not accomplish anything; the bees get destroyed as soon as they leave the honeycomb. A program that loses all its bees during runtime gets automatically terminated.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>*</code> creates 6 bees, each moving in one of the 6 possible directions
in the following order of creation: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p></li>
<li><p><code>\</code> creates 2 bees in the following order: first bee moving to the

<li><p><code>/</code> creates 2 bees in the following order: first bee moving to the

<li><p><code>_</code> creates 2 bees in the following order: first bee moving to the
right(dir. 0), second bee moving to the left (dir. 3).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>During program initialization the honeycomb is scanned for these 4 instructions column by column, starting in the upper left corner and ending in the lower right corner of the honeycomb.</p>

<p>A beeswax program may contain an arbitrary amount of these 4 instructions. All created bees are pushed on an IP stack, so the first bee executing code after initialization is the last bee that got pushed onto the IP stack.
After initialization, the creation instructions have no effect on program execution anymore and get ignored by the bees if they encounter these instructions.</p>

<p>In OpenSCAD, you can create simple animations. How, you ask? This is done using a special variable for animation:</p>

<pre><code>$t

<p>This variable repeatedly loops from 0 to 1, which your code can use to change the position of an object, rotate an object, or do pretty much anything when combined with control flow structures. OpenSCAD can dump png frames at user specified intervals to create videos and/or gifs.</p>

<p>Adding a <em>single line of code</em> to a program (in this case, one of the examples, which also happens to be the OpenSCAD logo), and running the output through a gif maker can turn it into an animation like this:

<h2>Length 3:</h2>

<p>There are a wealth of libraries in OpenSCAD, and one way to access them is via the command:</p>

<pre><code>use
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually two commands with similar functionality, but the other one has too many bytes. The main difference is that any top-level code (code outside a function/module) isn't executed with <code>use</code>, while it is executed for the <em>other</em> command. Both commands must be placed before any use of imported functions.</p>

<p>There are a couple of widely used libraries (Note that some of these should be added to the project with the other command instead):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SolidCode/MCAD" rel="noreferrer">MCAD</a>- this contains basic utilities (more shapes, gears, some math, etc), and often is installed automatically with OpenSCAD.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16193" rel="noreferrer">Write.scad</a>- Many of it's functions have been superseded by built-in functions in OpenSCAD, but it allows you to do a little more than the built-in functions can do (write curved text, for example).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bolts-library.org/en/index.html" rel="noreferrer">BOLTS</a>- This extensive library allows you to use standard hardware parts (and some non-standard hardware) in your projects.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Length 4:</h2>

<p>4 bytes is in that weird range where you can't really show off special variables or 1-character modifiers, but it's too short to really demonstrate the usage of a keyword. </p>

<p>However, it is the smallest whole program that isn't empty (or made up of only whitespace and semicolons) that compiles/runs without an error:</p>

<pre><code>a=1;
</code></pre>

<p>This just assigns 1 to the constant <code>a</code>. In OpenSCAD, almost everything is a constant within its scope. Recursion, iteration, and defining separate constants are two common ways to circumvent this limitation. Note that OpenSCAD is dynamically typed.</p>

<h2>Length 5:</h2>

<p>Much of OpenSCAD's power comes from its conditional branching. Assuming that <code>a</code> is a boolean value, you can write:</p>

<pre><code>if(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can put in any expression that evaluates to a boolean. This may be followed by a single statement, or by a code block surrounded by braces. The <code>if</code> statement shouldn't be used to conditionally assign variables, however—Any variable re-assignment creates a scope for the new variable which effectively shadows, not replaces the original variable. Conditional variable assignment must be done on declaration of the variable, with the ternary operator.</p>

<p>This one isn't too exciting, but it is very useful:</p>

<pre><code>[0:2:6]
</code></pre>

<p>This evaluates to an array. The first number is the starting value, the last number is the ending value, and the (optional) middle number is the step. For example, the previous line of code would evaluate to <code>[0,2,4,6]</code>. Arrays can be nested (jagged arrays and different levels of nesting are allowed) and they can be assigned to a variable.</p>

<h2>Length 8:</h2>

<p>This is one of the three main CSG operations in OpenSCAD:</p>

<pre><code>union(){
</code></pre>

<p>Now would be a good time to talk about the tree structures in OpenSCAD. In OpenSCAD, every object (in terms of 3D modeling, not OOP; OpenSCAD is definitely not OOP) is a node on a tree, and each can contain sub-trees. </p>

<p>Every OpenSCAD model is built from a handful of built-in <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Primitive_Solids" rel="noreferrer">primitive objects</a> (these primarily act as end-nodes), and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations" rel="noreferrer">various</a> built-in <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/CSG_Modelling" rel="noreferrer">operations</a> (these typically contain their own sub-trees). Additionally, you can define your own operations that either transform their sub-trees, or create a model on its own—but that's a topic for later on.</p>

<p>Back to <code>union</code>: this operator wraps everything in its sub-tree into one node (but doesn't do anything to the objects themselves), so that they can be treated as one whole unit when used in other operations. It may not do much on its own, but when combined with other operations, it can be a vital tool.</p>

<h2>Length 9:</h2>

<p>Here's a mouthful:</p>

<pre><code>minkowski
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>minkowski</code> function involves taking the <a href="http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Minkowski_sum_3/index.html" rel="noreferrer">minkowski sum</a> of an object. This one is a bit weird, as it is taking one shape, and moving it around the surface of another object. It's hard to explain in words, so an image is definitely helpful.</p>

<p>Non-summed:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/29IGX.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/29IGX.png" alt="Not summed"></a></p>

<p>Summed:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/SfDSR.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/SfDSR.png" alt="Summed"></a></p>

<p>The same process can also be extrapolated into the third dimension:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/SrmTF.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/SrmTF.png" alt="3D Non Summed"></a>
<a href="https://i.sstatic.net/hA2Io.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/hA2Io.png" alt="3D Summed"></a></p>

<p>Note that when using this, it can take a while for it to render, especially for more complex objects.</p>

<h2>Length 10:</h2>

<p>Here is another important CSG operation:</p>

<pre><code>difference
</code></pre>

<p>This takes the first element of its sub-tree, and "subtracts" every other object in the sub-tree from it. </p>

<p>For example, in this picture, the cylinder is being subtracted from the cube. Note that the debug modifier is used to make the cylinder visible:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/7SkZs.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/7SkZs.png" alt="Difference"></a></p>

<h2>Length 11:</h2>

<p>Finally, there are enough bytes to be able to define a module:</p>

<pre><code>module a(){
</code></pre>

<p>A module in OpenSCAD can define an object, operate on objects, or both. Everything (including the built-ins) that creates or modifies objects (not numbers, booleans, arrays, or strings, though; those are for functions, which I'll talk about in another section) is a module. The module can also accept variables (and define default values), though you have to be careful, as OpenSCAD is dynamically typed. Some modules can operate on their sub-trees; however, most modules won't do anything if they are passed a sub-tree. More info can be found <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/User-Defined_Functions_and_Modules#Modules" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Length 12:</h2>

<p>Finally, the third major CSG operation</p>

<pre><code>intersection
</code></pre>

<p>This takes the intersection of two objects.</p>

<p>For example, the intersection of these two objects:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/8Q79m.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/8Q79m.png" alt="Not Intersected"></a></p>

<p>would be:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/6zY7a.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/6zY7a.png" alt="Intersected"></a></p>

<p>Note that intersection doesn't work as expected when working with for loops, but there is <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Conditional_and_Iterator_Functions#Intersection_For_Loop" rel="noreferrer">a way around that</a>. This may to change in future versions, however.</p>

<h2>Length 13:</h2>

<p>Everything so far has been a yellow (or translucent red) color. How boring! You can spice it up with colors like "mediumspringgreen" and such, but since that would put this over the length limit, I'll choose a different color:</p>

<pre><code>color("cyan")
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, this changes the color of its subtree:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/y8kdA.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/y8kdA.png" alt="It&#39;s also &quot;aqua&quot;"></a></p>

<p>The <code>color</code> module accepts any of the standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color" rel="noreferrer">CSS/SVG color names</a>, and can also accept a vector of RGB colors (scaled from 0-1, <em>not</em> 0-255) with an optional transparency. More info on <code>color</code> <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Transformations#color" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Length 14:</h2>

<p>OpenSCAD includes the for loop, for simple iteration:</p>

<pre><code>for(i=[0:2:8])
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple finer points when dealing with for loops. For one, the loop variable can iterate over any array. As stated in the Length 7 snippet, <code>[0:2:8]</code> simply evaluates to <code>[0,2,4,6,8]</code> when looped through. Since OpenSCAD isn't type safe, make sure that the loop body can handle the loop effectively. Besides a special <code>for</code> loop for dealing with intersections, there are a couple variations that greatly expand the <code>for</code> loop's capability that I'll describe when there are more bytes.</p>

<h2>Length 15:</h2>

<p>Adding to the list of built-in modules:</p>

<pre><code>scale([x,y,z]){
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that <code>[x,y,z]</code> is a vector, which is basically an array in OpenSCAD. You can substitute the whole expression for a variable that equals a vector.) When applied to a sphere, you can do things like stretch it so it becomes a blimp-like shape:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/dc9qS.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/dc9qS.png" alt="Blimp"></a></p>

<p>This command can be applied to any sub-tree and have a similar effect.</p>

<h2>Length 16:</h2>

<pre><code>resize([5,8,10])
</code></pre>

<p>This command takes the bounding box of the subtree, and stretches (or shrinks) each axis to fit in a new bounding box. For example, say you have a sphere of radius 10:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/P9Pjh.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/P9Pjh.png" alt="Sphere"></a></p>

<p>If you resize it to a 5x8x10 bounding box, it becomes:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/kGZxB.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/kGZxB.png" alt="Whatever this is"></a></p>

<h2>Length 17:</h2>

<pre><code>linear_extrude(h)
</code></pre>

<p>(where h means height)</p>

<p>If I take this 2D square (size 10x10):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/unQKO.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/unQKO.png" alt="Square"></a></p>

<p>and I apply a linear extrude with a height of 5 to the square, then I get a rectangular prism:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/m0mZ1.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/m0mZ1.png" alt="Rectangular prism"></a></p>

<h2>Length 18:</h2>

<p>While you can't set arrays from inside a for loop (the variable inside the for loop shadows the variable in the wider scope), OpenSCAD compensates by adding list comprehensions.</p>

<pre><code>[for(i=[1:10])i*2]
</code></pre>

<p>This list comprehension iterates i from 1 through 10, and for each value of i, the result is 2i. This expression results in the array <code>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]</code>. Note that this array could have been produced with <code>[2:2:20]</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 19:</h2>

<pre><code>import("model.stl");
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that STL is a file format for 3D models. It contains a triangular mesh of all of the surfaces in a model.)</p>

<p>If I save the hilbert cube model from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:781532" rel="noreferrer">here</a> as <code>model.stl</code> in the same folder as the .scad file, OpenSCAD allows you to use it as a component of the model (e.g. you can perform CSG operations on the model).</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/NdLNv.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/NdLNv.png" alt="Hilbert cube"></a></p>

<h2>Length 20:</h2>

<p>Let's do some animation!</p>

<pre><code>$vpr= [45,0,$t*360];
</code></pre>

<p><code>$vpr</code> is a special variable in OpenSCAD. It contains the rotation of the viewport (<code>$vpt</code> and <code>$vpd</code> contain the translation and distance, respectively). If you assign them a new value, the viewport changes to that value. </p>

<p>As stated earlier, <code>$t</code> contains a value between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>To start with animation, click View > Animate. That will bring up a bar like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/KZQ91.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/KZQ91.png" alt="Bar"></a></p>

<p>Time will automatically change when you configure the other two values. This becomes the value of $t.</p>

<p>Steps means the amount of steps that <code>$t</code> will go through between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>FPS is the amount of steps OpenSCAD will go through every second.</p>

<p>If "Dump Pictures" is selected, as OpenSCAD goes through the animation, it will save the pictures sequentially.</p>

<p>With the above code, 30 steps, and 10 FPS, I get this exciting animation:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/wOqhc.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/wOqhc.gif" alt="Super exciting"></a></p>

<p>Of course, you can use <code>$t</code> in other places as necessary.</p>

<p>This is using a <em>dictionary</em> compression method. This will result into <strong>Hello, World!</strong>. Every ASCII character is interpreted as a normal character and every character with a code point above 127 is used for the decompression itself:</p>

<p>The input is first <code>D</code>uplicated, then printed with a newline <em>without</em> popping (using <code>=</code>). We take the len<code>g</code>th of the string, and create a for loop with <code>G</code> and each time we rotate the string 1 to the right using <code>Á</code> and print it again without popping.

<h3>Length 5 snippet:</h3>

<p>Code [<a href="http://05ab1e.tryitonline.net/#code=xb5uxb5v4oCh&amp;input=QWJjRGVm"><strong>Try it online!</strong></a>]:</p>

<pre><code>žnžo‡
</code></pre>

<p>This does the <em>Atbash</em> cipher. The <code>ž</code> command contains all kind of shortcuts to constants. Right now, the list of constants is:</p>

<pre><code>ž 23  &gt; ža           push current hours
        žb           push current minutes
        žc           push current seconds

        žj           push [a-zA-Z0-9_]
        žk           push [z-aZ-A]
        žl           push [z-aZ-A9-0_]

        žo           push [Z-Az-a]
        žp           push [Z-A]
</code></pre>

<p>So, we can conclude that <code>žn</code> is equal to <code>[A-Za-z]</code> and <code>žo</code> is equal to <code>[Z-Az-a]</code>. After this, we just perform a transliteration using <code>‡</code>.</p>

<p>This is maybe not a very tricky one, but certainly interesting. The <code>Œ</code> command computes all <em>substring</em> that can be made with the string.

<p>05AB1E is a language I, (Adnan), have made. It can be pronounced in several ways, like <strong>Osabie</strong>, <strong>Osable</strong>, <strong>Zero-five A B one E</strong>.

When interpreted as a hexadecimal number, converting this number to <em>Base64</em> would result into: <strong>Base</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu166" class="pu"><h1>Element</h1>

<p>This is a language that I invented in early 2012 to be a simple golfing language. By this, I mean that there is very little to no operator overloading. The operators are also simpler and fewer in number (all single characters) than most modern golfing languages.</p>

<p><strong>You can find the current version of the Element interpreter, written in Perl, right <a href="https://github.com/PhiNotPi/Element" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The most interesting features of this language are its data structures. There are <em>two</em> stacks and a hash that are used to store information.  One stack is used mainly for arithmetic, while the other is used mainly for logic.  The hash is used to store "variables."  The use of a hash means that the number of variables can be practically unbounded.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Length 1 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>#
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>#</code> operator removes and destroys a single item from the top of the main stack (the m-stack or arithmetic stack).  When standing alone, this doesn't do anything at all.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Length 2 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>_`
</code></pre>

<p>This is a "cat" program, or a program that outputs its input.  The <code>_</code> operator gets a line from STDIN and puts it on the main stack.  The <code>`</code> operator (a backtick) removes the top item from the main stack and prints it to STDOUT.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Length 3 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>!{}
</code></pre>

<p>This program is an infinite loop.  The <code>!</code> is a logical NOT. The control stack starts empty, logically equivalent to "false," so we must invert it and put a 1 on it.  The <code>{}</code> form a while loop. It repeats as long as the top value of the control stack is true (non-zero and non-empty-string).  Since the control stack will always have a 1 on top, this repeats forever.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Length 4 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>_2^`
</code></pre>

<p>This is a program that squares the input and prints the result.  The <code>^</code> is a operator which performs exponentiation.  Since this is stack-based, the 2 must be pushed on the stack before the ^ is performed.  The <code>^</code> is just one of the many basic arithmetic operations possible, such as addition or modulo.  All arithmetic takes place on the main stack.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Length 5 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>_'[_]
</code></pre>

<p>This code reads a line with a number as input and then reads that number of additional lines.  This can useful in some golf challenges.</p>

<p>The square brackets form a FOR block, which also doubles to serve as the language's IF block.  FOR blocks look at the top value on the control stack and repeat the code inside that number of times.  The first line of input is transferred to the control stack with <code>'</code>.  Element can be rather heavy with the apostrophes/quotation marks/backticks sometimes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Length 7 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>_,1+,#`
</code></pre>

<p>This takes a character from input and outputs the character with the character code 1 greater than that.  It's like a ROT1 cipher without the rotation.  The <code>,</code> is the char&lt;->code operator, which pushes both the number and code value for its input.  The first occurrence is used to convert to a number, of the second output is used.  IN the second occurrence, the number is discarded with <code>#</code> and the character is outputed.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Length 12 Snippet</h2>

<pre><code>1_'[3:~2@+]`
</code></pre>

<p>This prints the Nth Fibonacci number.  New commands here are <code>:</code>, <code>~</code>, and <code>@</code>.  The <code>:</code> operator creates copies of the top item on the main stack.  It's top argument, the 3 in this example, determines the number of copies.  So, <code>0:</code> is the same as <code>#</code>, <code>1:</code> is a co=op, <code>2:</code> makes one additional copy for a total of 2, etc.</p>

<p>The <code>~</code> is variable reading.  Given a string (which can also be a number) as an argument, it returns the value that was previously stored in that variable. In this example, we are reading from a variable (the number we just made copies of) that we never stored anything in.  This gives the empty string, which serves as one argument for the next operator.  If we simply replaced <code>~</code> with <code>0</code>, then we would have to insert a space between the <code>0</code> and the <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>@</code> is stack manipulation.  Element only has one operator for rearranging the order of stuff within the stack (as opposed to moving things between stacks, which are <code>'</code> and <code>"</code>).  The first (bottom) argument of <code>@</code> is the source index, and the second argument is the destination index.  In this program, the arguments are 0 (represented by the empty string) and 2, so this operator consumes those numbers, and then moves the 1st thing in the stack to be the 3rd thing in the stack.</p>

<pre><code>1                  push a 1
 _'                take input then move it to the control stack
   [      ]        FOR loop
   [3:    ]        make two additional copies of the top number (3 is the total count)
   [  ~   ]        turn one copy into a zero
   [   2@ ]        move from position 0 to position 2, behind the old number
   [     +]        add the old and newer number

<p>Lists use the syntax <code>{elem1elem2..elemn&lt;backtick&gt;</code> (can't actually put a backtick there for formatting issues). There is no separator, as Clip can figure out how many expressions there are. The reason for this weird syntax is that <code>{</code> initialises a ListBuilder, which consumes all expressions it receives and shoves them on its list. Backticks escape things, for example <code>+&lt;backtick&gt;</code> is the plus function in a format that can pass it to other functions. However, ListBuilders happen to become a list when escaped, so that's what happens.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>\</code> function converts a list to a human-readable string i.e. <code>{1 2 3 4 5&lt;backtick&gt;</code> becomes <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</code> instead of the default <code>12345</code>. The output of my length 3 snippet is not <code>{}</code>, however, as the default formatting for empty lists is as strings (lists of numbers with ischar: true). It is therefore <code>""</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 4 snippet</h1>

<pre><code>bW42
</code></pre>

<p><code>W</code> is a supplier that always returns 2 (this allows for no spaces between 2 and 42 here; just <code>242</code> would be interpreted as the number 242). <code>bxy</code> <em>supposedly</em> converts <code>y</code> to base <code>x</code> and returns a list of digits. So, what <em>should</em> this snippet return? <code>101010</code>, for 42 in base 2. But it actually returns <code>21010</code>. I don't know why, but that is not base 2. If you replace the 2 with 10, however, this function will always give the right answer (because in base <em>x</em>, 10 = <em>x</em>).</p>

<p>Edit: Turns out this was a bug in the v2 interpreter I was using; v5 seems to handle it correctly and print <code>101010</code>.</p>

<h1>Length 5 snippet</h1>

<pre><code>"..."
</code></pre>

<p>You expect this to print <code>...</code> (though the second quote would be unneeded), but <code>.</code> is Clip's escape character - like most languages' <code>\</code>. If you imagine this as <code>"\\\"</code>, it becomes clearer that the first escape escapes the second to make a literal <code>.</code>, and the last escape escapes the second quote to make it literally <code>"</code>. There is no closing quote, as these are unneeded, so this snippet prints <code>."</code>.</p>

<h2>5-vote</h2>

<pre><code>HAAZW
</code></pre>

<p>This is another simple program.</p>

<h3>Generation 0</h3>

<p><code>H</code> pushes <code>7</code>, <code>A</code> pushes <code>0</code>. <code>Z</code> is a fun command that pops <code>Y</code>, <code>X</code> and pushes the character at <code>FIELD[Y][X]</code>, or (X,Y). In this case, the character at (0,0) is <code>H</code>, and so it's char code is pushed. <code>W</code> outputs this as a character.</p>

<p>The two outer-most cells die.</p>

<h3>Generation 1</h3>

<p>We are left with <code>AAZ</code>, another call to <code>Z</code>, pushing <code>h</code>'s char code to the stack (as the former <code>H</code> is now dead and thus lowercase). However, since the <code>W</code> died, it can no longer function, and thus, this phase ends.</p>

<p>Once again, the two outermost cells die.</p>

<h3>Generation 2</h3>

<p>Now, only <code>A</code> is left, which carries out its duty in pushing a <code>0</code>, and then dies. The program is effectively stopped.</p>

<h2>4-vote</h2>

<pre><code>Bp
P
</code></pre>

<p>(newline counts as a character, iirc.) This does something rather simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>The program is first <code>BpP</code>. This pushes <code>1</code> (<code>B</code>), pops a value (<code>1</code>) and assumes it <code>p =&gt; P</code>, and does that again, popping a zero from the bottom of the stack <code>P =&gt; p</code>.

<ol>
<li>Checking, only the new <code>P</code> survives, as it popped a value and lived. The rest of the characters died.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>After, only the <code>P</code> remains; it pops an empty value (<code>0</code>) and dies.</li>
</ol>

<h2>3-vote</h2>

<pre><code>JXJ
</code></pre>

<p>First multi-step program! Here's what happens:</p>

<h3>Generation 0</h3>

<p>The code is evaluated: <code>J</code> pushes <code>9</code> to the stack, <code>X</code> pops a number and prints it, and <code>J</code> again pushes <code>9</code> ot the stack.</p>

<p>The cells' live-states are updated. Both <code>J</code>s die, having only 1 neighbour. The <code>X</code> lives, as it has 2 neighbours.</p>

<h3>Generation 1</h3>

<p>All that remains is the <code>X</code>. This prints the remaining <code>9</code> off the stack.</p>

<p>The <code>X</code> dies, and the program terminates.</p>

<h3>Final output</h3>

<pre><code>99
</code></pre>

<p>Hey, it's a start&hellip;</p>

<h2>2-vote</h2>

<pre><code>@V
</code></pre>

<p>The shortest (?) still life in GoLScript. <code>@</code> negates the top of the stack (effectively pushing <code>true</code>) and <code>V</code> reads the top of the stack, and dies if the value is falsey. Replacing <code>@</code> with any of <code>B-J</code> would also produce a still life.</p>

<h2>1-vote</h2>

<pre><code>X
</code></pre>

<p>Any 1-length program is valid. This one takes a zero of the stack (there is an infinite amount of zeroes atop the stack) and outputs it as a number.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong> <code>?</code></p>

<p>A special expression that returns a number taken from the input.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong> <code>0&gt;$</code></p>

<p>This is the first snippet here to show the <code>&gt;</code> symbol, which, in this language, is not a greater than operator but rather a symbol to separate an expression from its (optional) target designator. (The target designator <code>out</code>, meaning that the result should be printed to the output, is the default.) In this case, the target designator <code>$</code> indicates that the result should be floored and then stored to the instruction pointer (thereby going to that number line.) Going to line <code>0</code> is considered an exit statement, going to any other out-of-bounds line number triggers an exception.</p>

<div id="pu171" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/VTCAKAVSMoACE/Vitsy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vitsy</a></h1>

<p>I've been wanting to put this up for ages. Here we go...</p>

<h1>Factoid:</h1>

<p>Vitsy is a stack-based 1D programming language with a stack composed of stacks composed of doubles. At any point, the program stack may look like this:</p>

<pre>4 8 9      As you can see, each sub-stack may have its own unique length.
8 3 2
9 6 4      Items from the current stack will always be pulled from the top, unless 
3   3      otherwise specified by the user.
5</pre>

<p>These would technically be doubles, but, hey, it's a representation.</p>

<h1>Length 1 Snippet:</h1>

<pre>[</pre>

<p>The shortest stack overflow error you'll ever see.</p>

<p>Basically, in Vitsy, the <code>[</code> represents "start while loop". While in a while loop, the program will wrap around the line - which means it starts another while loop, which wraps around the line and starts another while...</p>

<p>You get it.</p>

<h1>Length 2 Snippet:</h1>

<pre>"N</pre>

<p>Prints the number 78 to STDOUT.</p>

<p>The character <code>"</code> captures any characters following it as a string and pushes it to the stack. Whenever Vitsy is capturing text, it wraps around the line. Therefore, <code>N</code> is pushed to the stack. Then, the character <code>N</code> prints the top item of the stack to STDOUT. ASCII Character 78 is <code>N</code>, therefore, 78 is printed to STDOUT.</p>

<h1>Length 3 Snippet</h1>

<p>Length 3... in characters.</p>

<pre>'Nߟ</pre>

<p>Since Vitsy reads unknown characters as NOPs and can read character values of UTF-8, the character <code>ߟ</code> translates to the number <code>2015</code>.</p>

<p>Happy late welcome to 2015, everybody.</p>

<h1>Length 4 Snippet</h1>

<pre>I\iO</pre>

<p>Just in case you ever want to reverse an input, this will grab the input a character at a time, reversing the string in the process.</p>

<h1>Length 5 Snippet</h1>

<pre>DmN
0</pre>

<p>This code will <em>always</em> error unless the number <code>1</code> is input.</p>

<p><code>m</code> tells the program to go to a line specified by the top item of the stack. If the number is <code>0</code>, it'll duplicate the top item and go to the <code>0</code>th line, the line with the <code>m</code> in it. This will throw the standard StackOverflowException. If it's <code>1</code>, it'll go to the first line (<code>0</code>), push <code>0</code> to the stack, go back to where it left off (<code>N</code>), and push the top item of the stack to STDOUT as a number (<code>0</code>). If it's greater than one, or less than 0, it'll throw an ArrayOutOfBoundsException, because it doesn't know where to look for the specified line.</p>

<h1>Length 6 Snippet</h1>

<p>The standard quine is simply:</p>

<pre>'rd3*Z
'      Capture all items as string until encountering another one
       of itself. If it does not find it before the end of the 
       line, it will loop around the line back to the start,
       which makes this capture all of the instructions as a string.
 r     Reverse the current stack
  d3*  Get the ASCII number of '
     Z Print everything in the stack out as a character.</pre>

<p>I love how short this is, and it was totally unintentional. :D</p>

<h1>Length 7 Snippet</h1>

<pre>DpD(!&lt;N</pre>

<p>This program will print out a single zero if the number input is not prime, and infinite 0s if it is prime. Basically, it tests if a number is prime. If it is, it skips the <code>&lt;</code>, which forces a backward loop (which will always find <code>0</code> because <code>1</code>, the truthy for the prime number test, is not prime.</p>

<h1>Length 8 Snippet</h1>

<pre>R\&Yv?vN</pre>

<p>I just realized I haven't introduced stack features. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>

<p>Vitsy also has stack manipulators - in this example, I grab input as an integer implicitly, get a random decimal in the range [0,20) and generate that number (when looping, we use the truncated integer as the repeat count) many times. Note that this will be in the range [1, 20], as there is already a stack.</p>

<h1>Length 9 Snippet:</h1>

<pre>00k
;use a</pre>

<p>So, let's say that you want to use another program (called "a") in your program. So what do you do?</p>

<p>You import it with <code>;use</code>. Then, you get the 0th index of the <code>;use</code> declaration's 0th line of code (<code>00k</code>). Very fancy classes. This will be the basis in which I will create libraries for <a href="https://github.com/VTCAKAVSMoACE/Vitsy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vitsy</a>. (Note that this is now <code>;u</code> - the declarations were changed to only the first letter as of a later update)</p>

<h1>Length 10 Snippet:</h1>

<p>What's the date again?</p>

<pre><code>")(etaD"nZ</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/VTCAKAVSMoACE/Vitsy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vitsy</a> doesn't have it's own way of getting the date - but it does have JavaScript eval worked into the code. That means that I can get the date string that JavaScript returns by pushing <code>Date()</code> to the stack, then eval with JS (<code>n</code>), then outputting the entire stack (<code>Z</code>). Fun, huh?</p>

<h1>Length 11 Snippet</h1>

<p>It's getting harder to make these. D:</p>

<pre><code>iG' ystiv',</code></pre>

<p>Well, this code is not fun. If you have <a href="https://github.com/VTCAKAVSMoACE/Vitsy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vitsy</a> saved as a system command (like I do), you can have problems like this. Basically, I grab the filename and push it to the stack with <code>iG</code> (push -1, get that index of class name), then I push 'vitsy ' behind it. Then I execute that in a shell.</p>

<p>Forkbomb = sad</p>

<h1>Length 14 Snippet</h1>

<pre><code>v&v\[y1-\?v?v]</code></pre>

<p>What I'm doing here is moving a prompted input number of items to a following stack. This would likely be used in a non-runnable class like so:</p>

<pre><code>;
v&v\[y1-\?v?v]</code></pre>

<p>And called like so:</p>

<pre><code>01k
;u something.vt</code></pre>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>I grab the top item of the stack (my number of items to move), make a new stack, push that number back in and repeat everything in the loop brackets that many times. <code>y1-</code> signifies the number of stacks currently in play minus one, so <code>y1-\?</code> goes to the stack previous of the one you're currently in (because <code>I'm an idiot</code> and never implemented going backwards - but don't worry, it'll be here soon).</p>

<h1>Length 15 Snippet - Fibonacci!</h1>

<pre><code>11[XD{+DN' 'O1]</code></pre>

<p>This outputs the fibonacci sequence, separated by spaces, to STDOUT infinitely.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, while making this code the first time, I realized that separating by spaces (with a small delay between each output) caused <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1416854/parabolas-in-sequences-of-digits-from-the-fibonacci-sequence">parabolas to appear in the output</a>.

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p><a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/PoGo" rel="nofollow">PoGo</a> is an esoteric programming language that consists only of two letter commands with one vowel and one consonant each, designed to make the source code read funny. It operates on a two dimensional memory grid and three different stacks.</p>

<h3>2 Characters</h3>

<pre><code>qi
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>poqigo
</code></pre>

<p><code>qi</code> is one of the special purpose output commands, just for fun (others include <code>wo</code> wich outputs "Hello, world!"). What's special about <code>poqigo</code>? Wait for the 6 characters program!</p>

<h3>4 Characers</h3>

<pre><code>isis
</code></pre>

<p>Output (example):</p>

<pre><code>What is my purpose?
What is my purpose?
</code></pre>

<p><code>is</code> is another special purpose output command, specified as "have an existentialist crisis". The message is choosen randomly, but at least in the official implementation it is memoized so that calling <code>is</code> twice gives the same output twice.</p>

<h3>6 Characters</h3>

<pre><code>poqigo
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>poqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigopoqigo[...]
</code></pre>

<p>In the documentation, <code>poqigo</code> is mentioned as an example for a quine and obviously that's the only purpose of the <code>qi</code> command, but it actually isn't a real quine since it outputs itself infinitely, not just once.</p>

<p>With this example we learn the basics of flow control in PoGo. You use a call stack (the "po" stack):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>po</code> - add current position in code to the top of the po stack</li>
<li><code>go</code> - pop the most recent po location off the stack and jump there</li>
</ul>

<p>So <code>po</code> ... <code>go</code> produces a loop and if you don't use any conditions to break out of it, it's an endless loop</p>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> The R programming language began as a GNU implementation of the S programming language. It is primarily used for statistics and related applications.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Though not a requirement of the competition, every snippet here can be run on its own in R.</p>

<p><strong>Length 32:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>`[.data.frame`(swiss,3,2,drop=F)

<p>This looks a little mysterious... and indeed it should! There's a much better way to write this:</p>

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>swiss[3, 2, drop = FALSE]
</code></pre>

<p>That should look a bit more familiar. Here's what happens when we run either of these pieces of code:</p>

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>&gt; `[.data.frame`(swiss,3,2,drop=F)
             Agriculture
Franches-Mnt        39.7
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>swiss</code> data frame ships with R like several others we've seen so far. It contains fertility and socioeconomic indicators for 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland from around the year 1888. The third row is for the province Franches-Mnt, and the second column is the percent of males involved in agriculture as a profession in each province. So in 1888, 39.7% of males in the Franches-Mnt province of Switzerland worked in agriculture.</p>

<p>When you extract rows or columns from a data frame using the simpler notation, R is actually using <code>[.data.frame</code> in the background. As we saw in snippet 24, pretty much anything can be defined as a function name so long as its surrounded in back ticks, so our snippet here is legit even though the function name technically contains unmatched brackets.</p>

<p>The <code>drop=</code> argument tells R whether you want it to drop the result into a lower dimension if possible. Indeed, if we say <code>drop=TRUE</code>, we get this:</p>

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>&gt; `[.data.frame`(swiss,3,2,drop=T)

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>summary(lm(mag~depth,quakes))
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few things going on here, so let's take them one step at a time.</p>

<p><code>quakes</code> is a dataset that ships with R. It contains information about 1000 seismic events of magnitude greater than 4.0 on the Richter scale near Fiji since 1964. Two of the columns in the dataset are <code>mag</code>, which is the magnitude of the earthquake, and <code>depth</code>, which is the depth of the epicenter in kilometers.</p>

<p>The <code>lm()</code> function, as mentioned in snippet 28, fits linear models. It returns an <code>lm</code> object, or more precisely, an object of class <code>lm</code>. There are two ways to specify the predictor (or <em>independent</em> variable) and the response (or <em>dependent</em> variable), and I've chosen the formula method. This takes the form <code>response ~ predictor</code>. Multiple predictors are specified as <code>y ~ x1 + x2</code>. The objects in the formula are evaluated in the context provided in the next argument.</p>

<p>So what <code>lm(mag ~ depth, quakes)</code> is doing is fitting a linear model using ordinary least squares regression where magnitude is the response and depth is the predictor. It knows what <code>mag</code> and <code>depth</code> are because we told it that they come from <code>quakes</code>.</p>

<p><code>summary()</code> is a generic function used primarily for summarizing the results of fitted models. It invokes a method particular to the class of its argument. Since we passed an <code>lm</code> object, it's actually invoking a function called <code>summary.lm()</code>.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we get the summary of the linear model attempting to explain earthquake from earthquake depth. Specifically, this is what R spits out:</p>

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>&gt; summary(lm(mag~depth,quakes))

Call:
lm(formula = mag ~ depth, data = quakes)

<p>Notice how the first thing it tells you is the function call? That's because the <code>lm()</code> function uses <code>match.call()</code>, just like we did in snippet 28!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Length 28:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>f&lt;-function(x,y)match.call()

<p>R functions often like to keep track of what you tell them. Indeed, sometimes the command you've submitted is given back to you as an attribute of the returned object. (An example is <code>lm()</code>, which creates linear models.) Recalling the precise instructions is accomplished using <code>match.call()</code> within the function.

<p>For the sake of disorientation, let's swap the directions, so columns are now east-west and rows are south-north. We can do this using a matrix transpose, accomplished via <code>t()</code>. And why not make a contour map while we're at it? <code>filled.contour()</code> does just that.</p>

<pre class="lang-r prettyprint-override"><code>pmatch("s",c("n","size"))

<p>The <code>pmatch()</code> function provides the magic behind all the partial matching we've seen so far. The first argument is a string which is compared against each element of the second argument, a vector. If there's a unique match, the index of the matching element is returned, otherwise you get <code>NA</code>.</p>

<p>The snippet here is a "real-world" example of the use of this function. Think back to snippet 13 where we used the <code>sample()</code> function. It accepts arguments <code>n</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>replace</code>, and <code>prob</code>, but only requires the first two. In snippet 13 we used <code>s=</code> as shorthand for <code>size=</code>. What's actually going on in the background is something like this snippet, where what we've provided is compared against what's expected. Since "s" matches "size" uniquely, it's totally legit to use <code>s=</code> as shorthand.</p>

<p>A perfect example of something you shouldn't do! Ever!</p>

<p>You can assign characters as functions so long as you surround them in back ticks when defining the function. Here we told R that <code>(</code> is a function that always returns 9 regardless of the input. Like in many other languages, <code>;</code> can be used for including two commands on one line. So what we've told R is to define the function <code>(</code>, then print <code>2*(3-1)</code>.</p>

<p>Now, just about any person would tell you that 2*(3-1) should be 4 because you do 3-1=2, then 2*2=4. But we've told R that anything inside parentheses is 9. So while 3-1=2, we now have (3-1)=9. Then we get 2*(3-1) = 2*9 = 18.</p>

<p>Since awful things like this are possible, every time you submit code that contains parentheses in an expression (i.e. not a function call), the R interpreter actually goes looking for any functions called <code>(</code> regardless of whether you've defined <code>(</code> as a function. In general, the more you write, the more work the R interpreter does.</p>

However, <code>qplot()</code> is a simpler interface to some of the core features of the package and has syntax akin to <code>plot()</code> in base R.

The first argument to the <code>deriv()</code> function is an R expression (which is an actual R type) in terms of some variable, in this case <code>x</code>. The second argument is the name of the variable with respect to which the derivative is taken, here <code>"x"</code>.</p>

<p>If the arguments to <code>c()</code> contain only a single type, no type casting occurs, e.g. if all arguments are logicals (<code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>), the vector will be all logicals. If it contains logicals and numbers, it will be all numbers. If it contains character and anything, it will be all character. So our snippet gives us this:</p>

<p>Finally a program with a bend! But it doesn't do anything useful :(</p>

<p>The current location starts in the top left corner facing "diagonally down and right".  The current location always moves with inertia - it will move in the direction it is already moving until it can no longer do that and then will move in a direction closest to the current direction.</p>

<p>So the current location moves "diagonally down and right" and arrives at the next bend.  It is a 225 degree bend so if the stack were to contain a zero it would push one character of standard input onto the stack and if it were a nonzero value then a value from the stack would be written to standard output.  But there is nothing on the stack so the bend is a no-op.</p>

<p>Now the current location moves around the bend without doing anything, the current direction is towards the left and we are at another bend.  This one is a 270 degree bend so if the stack were to contain a nonzero value the current direction would reverse.  But there is nothing on the stack so the bend is a no-op.</p>

<p>Now the current location moves around the bend without doing anything, the current direction is up and we are at another bend.  It is a 270 degree bend so if the stack were to contain a nonzero value the current direction would reverse.  But there is nothing on the stack so the bend is a no-op.</p>

<p>Now the current location moves around the bend without doing anything, and we are in an infinite loop.</p>

<p>There are only four ways to get values onto the stack:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push a 1</li>
<li>Subtract two values already on the stack</li>
<li>Use a value on the stack to decide to read from standard input</li>
<li>Use corordinates on the stack to read a value embedded in the program</li>

<p>So the only way to get a value onto an empty stack is to push a 1.</p>

<p>Hexagony is a 2D esoteric language made by Martin Büttner based on hexagons. Not only the programs self are hexagons, but the memory model of terror is also based on hexagons. It took me quite some time to understand the model of terror, but eventually I still don't get it. First time I programmed in this, I was happy to get <em>anything</em> outputted, but after a while I realised that this is a very interesting language, with a lot to discover. I would definitely recommend programming in Hexagony.</p>

<p>Let's talk a bit about the memory model in Hexagony. Every memory edge has a standard value, <code>0</code>. This is different from some other models, which are standard <code>null</code>. The second thing which makes this memory model different, is that the data kept in the memory edges are always numbers. No strings, lists, tuples and so on. For this program, I'm  going to introduce you to the command <code>!</code>. This outputs the <em>decimal</em> representation of the current memory edge. <code>;</code> would do the same thing, but outputs the <em>ASCII</em> representation.</p>
<p>So, you can already expect what this is going to do. This is going to print an infinite amount of <code>0</code>. <strong>After running in the online interpreter, immediately kill it</strong>. It won't stop, <em>ever</em>.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>So, you might be wondering... When can you make this stop? That is done with the <code>@</code> command. After reaching this point, the program terminates. That means we can now safely output one <code>0</code> with the program. Another thing you might be wondering is 'What are all those dots doing there?'. That brings us to the next command, the no-op <code>.</code>. When the pointer comes to a no-op, it will not do anything and continues its way in the same direction. This means that <code>!@</code> and <code>!@...</code> and <code>!@.....</code> are all the same and give the same output. However, if we add another dot: <code>!@......</code>, this would give a bigger hexagon, since the maximum amount for a two-sided hexagon is smaller than the length of the program. It would give the following:</p>
<pre><code>  ! @ .

<pre><code>9!@
</code></pre>
<p>Or in hexagon form:</p>
<pre><code> 9 !
@ . .
 . .
</code></pre>
<p>First of all, decimals in the program will be added to the current memory edge. If the memory egde = <code>402</code> and passes by a <code>3</code>, the new memory edge will contain <code>4023</code>. Same counts for letters, which replaces the memory edge with the ASCII value of the letter. I'll now explain how pointers move in Hexagony. But first of all, there isn't just one pointer. There are <em>six</em>. Each in every corner:</p>
<pre><code>  0 . 1
 . . . .
5 . . . 2
 . . . .
  4 . 3
</code></pre>
<p>They all point clockwise, so <code>0</code> would go to the east (<code>E</code>), the <code>1</code> would go to the southeast (<code>SE</code>) and so on. The standard active pointer is <code>0</code>, and you can switch the active pointer using the <code>[</code> and the <code>]</code> command. The next thing is, what happens when they get out of the board? When they leave at a non-corner point, they will enter the board again in the other half of the program (pointer starts at <code>A</code>):</p>
<pre><code>   . . . .        . F . .        . A . .        . . A .
  A B C D E      . . G . .      . B . . F      . . B . .
 . . . . . .    A . . H . .    . C . . G .    . . C . . G
. . . . . . .  . B . . I . .  . D . . H . .  . . D . . H .
 F G H I J K    . C . . J .    E . . I . .    . E . . I .
  . . . . .      . D . . K      . . J . .      F . . J .
   . . . .        . E . .        . K . .        . . K .
</code></pre>
<p>If the pointer leaves from a corner, it depends on what value the current memory edge has (from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code>):</p>
<pre><code>                     memory &gt; 0            memory &lt;= 0

     . . A -&gt;          . . .              -&gt; B . .
    . . . .           . . . .               . . . .
-&gt; B . . . .         . . . . A -&gt;          . . . . A -&gt;
    . . . .           . . . .               . . . .

<p>First, it begins at the top left <code>!</code>, so this will output <code>0</code>. After that, it goes to the <code>$</code>, which is a jump. This will skip the next command, which is <code>!</code>. So the <code>0</code> isn't outputted twice. After that, the pointer gets to the <code>)</code>. This is an increment command, which just adds <code>1</code> to the current memory edge. After that, the pointer leaves the hexagon in the right corner and re-enters at the bottom left (see previous snippet to see why). As you can guess, this will output <code>012345678910111213141516171819202122232425...</code>.</p>

That gives us <code>41</code>, which is the closing parenthese (<code>)</code>). After outputting this character, the program decreases the current memory edge by 1 and goes into an infinite loop.

<p>In the beginning, the memory model starts at the <code>a</code>. The <code>?</code> pushes the input onto the memory edge <code>a</code>. After that, the <code>}</code> switches to the right memory edge, which is <code>b</code>. There we push the input to the memory edge <code>b</code>. The <code>&quot;</code> moves the memory pointer backwards and to the left, which is <code>c</code>. The <code>*</code> calculates the product of the two neighbours, which are <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, prints it and terminates.</p>

<p>Yes, this gives us a size 3 hexagon. That is because the program can't fit in a size 2 hexagon. In the hope to create a Fibonacci sequence, I ended up with this. It gives the following sequence:</p>

<p>SAS is a data manipulation 4th generation language dating all the way back to 1966. Despite its age, it is still widely used to this day, particularly in financial and pharmaceutical environments where a large legacy codebase has been built up over the past few decades.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, this is the only complete and valid SAS statement of length 1 - a null statement.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>x;
</code></pre>

<p>SAS was born out of an effort to get code from one platform working on another. It has many OS-agnostic commands for interacting with the host operating system. The x statement is one of these. A null x statement opens up a command prompt / terminal for user input.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>

<pre><code>%a:
</code></pre>

<p>As well as the primary language (consisting mainly of data steps, procs and global statements), a macro language was added in SAS 5. With 3 characters, we can define a 1-letter label for use with a macro <code>%goto</code> statement.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>run;
</code></pre>

<p>Analysts typically write SAS programs in an interactive environment (the SAS Enhanced Editor window). A <code>run</code> statement is required in order to tell SAS to execute all the (non-macro) code that's been compiled since the last run statement. As there is often a lot of back-and-forth editing and re-running of various steps within programs, it is quite common to see a <code>run</code> statement at the end of every data step and proc in a program, even though most of them are probably not necessary when running the whole thing from end to end.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>quit;
</code></pre>

<p>Some SAS procs support multiple sequentially executed <code>run</code> groups and will therefore not terminate until a <code>quit</code> statement is issued. Others do not and will throw an error if they receive a <code>quit</code> statement. Still others accept only a <code>quit</code> statement and will throw an error if they receive a <code>run</code> statement. Working out which are which can be rather frustrating for new users.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>set a;
</code></pre>

<p>SAS data steps usually operate in an implicit loop from an initial <code>data</code> statement to a final <code>run</code> statement (or the start of another data step, global statement, or proc). Each time a <code>set</code> statement is executed, SAS reads the next record from the input sas dataset(s) into an area of memory known as the Program Data Vector, where individual variables can be manipulated with data step functions until the end of that iteration of the data step is reached and the record is written to the output file or dataset. This process repeats until the last record has been read from the input dataset and duly processed.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>link a;
</code></pre>

<p>SAS has two different versions of <code>goto</code> !</p>

<p><code>link</code> and <code>goto</code> statements will both send you to a label elsewhere in the data step, but the difference between them is what happens when you subsequently reach a (possibly implicit) return statement. If you last came from a <code>goto</code> statement, you go back to the start of the implicit data step loop for a new iteration, but if you last came from a <code>link</code> statement, you go back to the statement just after the (most recent) <code>link</code> statement and continue the current iteration.</p>

<p>Although it stops short of explicitly advising programmers not to use these statements, the SAS help file diplomatically points out that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GO TO statements can often be replaced by DO-END and IF-THEN/ELSE
  programming logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>

<pre><code>%let a=;
</code></pre>

<p>This creates/overwrites a zero-character macro variable <code>a</code>. It may be local or global, depending on whether the <code>%let</code> statement runs within a macro or in open code. It can be referred to elsewhere in the program as <code>&amp;a</code>. Syntactically, this is not a special case - you never need to use quotes when defining macro variables this way, unless you want to produce a string that contains them! Also, all macro variable values are trimmed when assigned, so inserting whitespace between <code>=</code> and <code>;</code> has no effect.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>a="""''";
</code></pre>

<p>In a data step, this assigns the value <code>"''</code> to the variable <code>a</code>. SAS parses the outermost pair of double quotes first, then replaces each inner instance of two consecutive double quotes with a single double quote. The consecutive single quotes are unaffected. The converse happens if you replace the outer double quotes with single quotes. </p>

<p>Strange though it may seem, this functionality can actually be very useful, as it tends to be a lesser evil than using macro quoting functions. Woe betide you should you accidentally try this with an odd number of double quotes, though...</p>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre><code>%quote(%()
</code></pre>

<p>Loosely speaking, the macro processor resolves anything that looks like a macro call (i.e. with a preceding % sign) during compilation, and makes another pass during execution for anything that turns out to be a macro function or variable. Sometimes you need to mask characters that would normally be parsed as macro tokens, or which would otherwise affect compilation. This is one of the most fiddly aspects of SAS.</p>

<p>Depending on precisely what you want to do, SAS has about a dozen different macro quoting functions to choose from, which all behave slightly differently. <code>%quote</code> masks macro characters during macro execution. As demonstrated here, you can also use % characters within certain macro quoting functions to tell the macro processor not to expect a balancing quote or bracket.</p>

<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>

<pre><code>if first.a;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a common data step use case of by-group processing - one of the most distinctive features of SAS. When you use a <code>by</code> statement, SAS uses a system of input buffers to keep track of whether any of the <code>by</code> variables have changed value between iterations. E.g. to use the above snippet, you would need something like <code>by a;</code> first in your data step. Usually, this needs the dataset to be sorted in ascending order.</p>

<p>This snippet is equivalent to <code>if not(first.a) then delete;</code> which under most circumstances means <em>if the current value of <code>a</code> appeared in a previous row, stop this iteration of the data step and don't output the current row</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 12</strong></p>

<pre><code>*";*';*);*/;
</code></pre>

<p>One of the joys of the SAS Enhanced Editor window - the setting in which one can run SAS code interactively - is that it is quite easy to accidentally submit an incomplete fragment of code for processing. When this happens, SAS will often appear to have stopped responding, usually because it thinks you've left a comment, bracket or quoted string open and is waiting patiently for you to close it. This snippet is an example of a 'magic string' that when submitted enough times may enable you to regain control of your session. Or not.</p>

<p><strong>Length 13</strong></p>

<pre><code>data a/debug;
</code></pre>

<p>One largely forgotten component of SAS is the interactive data step debugger. This functions in a similar manner to the MS Office Visual Basic Editor, allowing you to execute iterations of a data step one line at a time and check the values of variables at each point. However, due to the amount of keyboard input required to operate the debugger once you've launched it, it's usually quicker just to modify your data step code so that it prints the equivalent diagnostic information directly to the SAS log.</p>

<p><strong>Length 14</strong></p>

<pre><code>array a{2}(1);
</code></pre>

<p>In SAS, arrays are very transient things - merely a way to pick variables from a list numerically rather than by name for the duration of a data step. Once it finishes executing, the variables may still be present somewhere, but the array is gone.</p>

<p>When called in a data step, this snippet creates a numeric array called <code>a</code> containing two elements, which are auto-named <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code>. <code>a1</code> is initialised (to 1) but <code>a2</code> is not and takes the missing value <code>.</code>.The elements can be referred to as <code>a[i]</code>, where <code>i</code> is a numeric variable or constant. Values of the array variables are retained across observations. The elements of a can be referred to as <code>a[i]</code>, where <code>i</code> is a numeric variable or constant.</p>

<p>The second set of brackets are required to be round brackets <code>()</code>, but the first set can be replaced with square brackets <code>[]</code> or braces <code>{}</code>. Similarly, you can use any of these when referring to array elements in code.</p>

<p><strong>Length 15</strong></p>

<pre><code>a='01jan1960'd;
</code></pre>

<p>We finally have enough characters to show an example of using a SAS date literal. The SAS date epoch is 1st January 1960, so this snippet is equivalent to <code>a=0;</code>. The core SAS language has no concept of data types beyond character and numeric, so even though we've used a date literal there's no way to distinguish between the raw output of these two statements. It's important to note that literals don't behave the same way in the macro language - if you ran something like <code>%let a='01jan1960'd;</code> then the resulting macro variable would be treated as a string until it was evaluated within a core language statement or function.</p>

<p><strong>Length 16</strong></p>

<pre><code>where a=*"John";
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to some other languages, SAS has a modest set of operators (perhaps unsurprisingly, given the limited number of types). However, SAS still found space to include one for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex">SOUNDEX</a> matching. When included in a data step or proc, this line restricts the input to records where the variable <code>a</code> sounds like <code>John</code> - e.g. <code>Jane</code> would match. Unlike most other SAS operators, the sounds-like operator is only valid in where clauses, not in more general expressions.</p>

<p><strong>Length 18</strong></p>

<pre><code>input a is8601dt.;
</code></pre>

<p>One of the strongest features of SAS is its ability to read data stored in practically any imaginable format with a relatively modest amount of code. The <code>input</code> statement has quite a complex syntax and can be challenging to use, but offers the greatest flexibility when reading in external data out of all the available methods in SAS. </p>

<p>The snippet above uses the built-in <code>is8601dt.</code> datetime informat to read in text of the form <code>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss</code> from the start of each line of an input file and store it as a numeric SAS datetime variable <code>a</code>. E.g. the text <code>2014-12-31T23:59:59</code> would be stored as <code>1735689599</code> - the number of seconds since 1st January 1960.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>One curious historical quirk of SAS is that it has ended up with two procs that calculate summary statistics for datasets, with near-identical features and syntax - <code>proc means</code> and <code>proc summary</code>. In early versions of SAS these were distinct procs, but over the decades they've converged to the point where they now share a help page. This example highlights one of the few remaining differences - <code>proc means</code> will output to the listing area by default, unless as here you tell it not to, whereas <code>proc summary</code> doesn't. Although this is a valid SAS statement, it is not a complete call to the proc - at a bare minimum, to request default statistics for the last used dataset, you would need to add a <code>run;</code> afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Length 20</strong></p>

<pre><code>data a(index=(var));
</code></pre>

<p>Another strength of SAS is its ability to crunch through vast volumes of data on disk, without requiring similarly vast amounts of memory - this has historically been one of the main advantages of SAS over R, though in recent years R has been catching up. As with other DBMS software, indexes help tremendously when you only need to extract a small proportion of records. This statement tells SAS to index the variable <code>var</code> when creating the dataset <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>When working with particularly huge datasets, normal SAS indexes can prove inadequate due to their rather generalised design - as a result, people have developed <a href="http://analytics.ncsu.edu/sesug/2011/BB16.Keintz.pdf">their own more specialised ones</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 21</strong></p>

<pre><code>%macro a(b,c=);%mend;
</code></pre>

<p>We now have enough characters available to define a trivial macro. In SAS a macro is simply a way of generating text, which is then interpreted as if it were non-macro code. Eventually, anyway - sometimes multiple passes are required to resolve all macro tokens.</p>

<p>Our macro could called like so:</p>

<pre><code>%a(1,c=2);
</code></pre>

<p>This would create two local macro variables, with values b=1 and c=2, and then exit, generating no further code. In SAS-speak, b is a <em>positional parameter</em> of %a, and c is a <em>keyword parameter</em>. Positional parameters, when specified, must always go before keyword parameters (and in the correct order) when calling a macro, unless you refer to them by name. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>%a(c=2, b=1); /*Assigns both values as expected*/
%a(c=2);      /*Sets &amp;b to an empty string*/
%a(c=2, 1);   /*Throws an error*/
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 22</strong></p>

<pre><code>%let a=a;%put &amp;a.&amp;&amp;&amp;a;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a highly circuitous method of printing the text <code>aa</code> to the SAS log. The initial <code>%put &amp;a</code> is straightforward enough- this simply resolves <code>&amp;a</code> to its value <code>a</code>. The <code>.</code> tells SAS that it has reached the end of the name of the macro variable, and is not printed. What happens with <code>&amp;&amp;&amp;a</code> is more complex. In the first pass through the code, the macro processor resolves <code>&amp;a</code> to <code>a</code>, its assigned value, and resolves <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to <code>&amp;</code>. In the second pass, the macro processor sees only <code>&amp;a</code> and resolves this to <code>a</code>, which is then appended to the <code>a</code> from earlier and printed to the log. If you need to go several layers of variables in, the number of <code>&amp;</code> signs required increases exponentially.</p>

<p><strong>Length 23</strong></p>

<pre><code>proc datasets lib=work;
</code></pre>

<p>This has been described as the 'Swiss Army Knife of SAS procs', and with good reason. As well as listing, copying, appending, deleting and renaming SAS files (including, but not limited to, datasets), it can also be used to make all sorts of changes to the metadata <em>within</em> SAS datasets - things like variable names, formats and so on - without having to run a wasteful data step that overwrites the whole dataset. It is among the minority of procs that allow multiple <code>run;</code> groups (as mentioned in example 5), and requires a final <code>quit;</code> statement after the last one. This modest example lists the contents of the temporary work library.</p>

<p><strong>Length 24</strong></p>

<pre><code>dcl hash h(dataset:'a');
</code></pre>

<p>Hash objects were first made available in SAS 9.1. The above statement, when run in a data step, declares and instantiates a hash object <code>h</code> containing variables from the dataset <code>a</code>. This is cheating slightly, as some additional statements are required to declare the key variable(s) you want to use to store/retrieve items in the hash, and optionally some data variables associated with each combination of keys. The most common use of hash objects is for merging small datasets onto much larger ones, as using a hash lookup to retrieve values from a small dataset avoids having to sort the other (much larger) dataset.</p>

<p><strong>Length 25</strong></p>

<pre><code>proc format cntlin=a;run;
</code></pre>

<p>Before we had hash objects, the next best thing was a <em>format merge</em>. This worked by defining a custom format to translate lookup keys to lookup values, effectively resulting in the lookup dataset being loaded into memory. This snippet takes a specially structured dataset <code>a</code> and uses it to define one or more formats. </p>

<p>Format merges can outperform hash merges if you only need to look up one variable from your lookup dataset, but they have some limitations. A format can only be applied to one variable, so if your lookup depends on a combination of keys, you have to concatenate them - a messy process. Each key can then only be mapped to one value per format, so if you have multiple lookup variables you end up having to load the keys from the lookup dataset into memory multiple times - distinctly sub-optimal for larger lookup datasets.</p>

<p>This demonstrates the unconditional n-trampoline, <code>@</code> (its cousins are <code>! ? &amp;</code>). Minkolang's codebox is toroidal, meaning that when the spaceship goes off any edge, it reappears on the opposite edge. Here, <code>3@</code> skips the next three instructions in the direction of travel, namely <code>.3@</code>, in that order. So it lands directly on the <code>.</code>, which stops the program.</p>

<p>This is the shortest program producing output (and stopping). <code>N</code> pops the top of stack and outputs it as an integer and <code>.</code> stops execution. When the stack is empty, any operation that tries to pop from the stack will pop a 0 as it has a bottomless well of 0s. Thus, <code>N</code> will output <code>0 </code> (with a trailing space) and then stop.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Minkolang is a Minkowskian (2+1)D stack-based semi-golfing language. The &quot;Minkowskian (2+1)D&quot; part simply means that there are two dimensions of space and one of time. The spaceship (or <em>program counter</em>, if you prefer) travels through time when it's not traveling through space. This might sound weird, but consider this: you are barely moving, sitting in your chair. Even if you include the motions imparted by the Earth's rotation, the Earth's journey around the Sun, and the Sun's journey around the Milky Way, it's still only a tiny fraction of the speed of light. So you move through time at almost exactly the rate of one second per second. If, however, you are moving through space at the speed of light, then <em>time stops</em>. Likewise, the spaceship in Minkolang moves through time when it can, when it's not moving through space! Any instruction that does not change its direction preserves it, and wherever there is a space that the spaceship is not boosted across, it starts moving through time (represented as the layers of the program).</p>

<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>'"A"'

<p>This is a string that, when evaluated, pushes the singleton string <strong>A</strong> on the stack. There is no way to escape a quote in ShapeScript, so two different kinds of quotes are required to use strings in evaluated strings.</p>

<p>I have chosen to use this snippet because of its weirdness. So the first bit of the code says that the stack is <code>0</code>. Then the <code>*</code> is string multiplication. It multiplies <code>&quot;0&quot;</code> 2 times. One would expect the output to be <code>00</code>, but no! <code>000</code> is outputted instead. So the stack is repeated <code>2+1=3</code> times, which gives <code>000</code>. This trick is useful for golfing when  you want to output the stack 10 times. Instead of going <code>(stack)^*10</code>, you will do <code>(stack)^*9</code> because it saves <strong>one</strong> byte!</p>

This checks if the stack is a prime or not(works for the number 1). This primality checking works on the stack both as a <em>string</em> or as a number. This &quot;special power&quot; of <code>P</code> can make it more useful for code-golfing.</p>

<p>Simplex is a golfing language which functions similar to BrainF***, made by me. It is very much a work in progress, but has about 60 standard commands. It is composed of a singular field, which holds a bottom-closed, top-open, infinite amount of strips, each of which contains a right-open, left-closed, infinite amount of cells and a pointer. The field can be visualized as thus:</p>

<pre><code>5: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ]
    ^
4: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ]
    ^
3: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ]
    ^
2: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ]
    ^
1: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ]
    ^
0: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ]
    ^
</code></pre>

<p>Each pointer moves independent of other pointers. Typically, only one or two strips are utilized in a single program.</p>

<div id="pu189" class="pu"><h1>LambdaMOO</h1>

<p>LambdaMOO is a server for running an object-oriented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD" rel="nofollow">MUD</a> which can be programmed live by the players themselves. The LambdaMOO server handles the telnet connection for each player, reading in what the player types, parsing it and running the correct verb. It also persists all of the objects to a database, meaning you can shut down a server and bring it back up and the environment will be exactly where you left it. (It's much like a smalltalk image  in this regard.)</p>

<p>The oldest running LambdaMOO server (up since 1991) is at <a href="http://lambda.moo.mud.org/" rel="nofollow">lambda.moo.mud.org</a>; you can telnet to port 8888 and log in as a guest to look around.</p>

<p>This answer will cover the LambdaMOO programming language (which has no separate name), but will of necessity touch upon other aspects of the LambdaMOO environment, such as the server, players and databases.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Factoid</h2>

<p>LambdaMOO code is stored as bytecode and decompiled for editing. The original intent was for it to be stored and edited offline, then uploaded to the server. In practice, it turned out to be easier to edit it live on the server, so a decompiler was implemented. The bytecode is expressive enough that this tends not to be an issue, and it has the advantage of enforcing a uniform coding style!</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>Like many languages, LambdaMOO statements are semicolon-terminated, and an empty statement is valid. However, it is optimised away by the compiler and won't be there when the program is edited again! (This same compiler optimization also cleans up empty else statements and the like.)</p>

<p><code>;</code> is also used as a synonym for <code>eval</code> at the beginning a line of user input, allowing programmers to test code without writing an entire verb. (Normally, user input is interpreted as English-like commands such as <code>go west</code> or <code>take the box</code>.)</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<p>Because it is designed for programming an interactive environment, LambdaMOO objects are persistent and are identified by a unique number. They have two types of data associated with them, properties (data) and verbs (code). Both properties and data are inherited from an object's parents, and can be overridden.</p>

<p>Object numbers are represented as <code>#nnn..</code>, starting from 0 and counting up. The first LambdaMOO server (<code>lambda.moo.mud.org</code>) has been running since at least early 1991 and is up to <code>#124703</code>. It would be a lot further than that if they hadn't implemented object number reuse around 1996. Objects are not usually created and recycled automatically; instead, they are created by players to represent persistent "physical" objects--rooms, players, a wind-up duck, and so on. Because of the "Virtual Reality" design, even objects which wouldn't ordinarily be physical are generally represented as such on a MOO. For instance, the database of player's birthdays is "<code>a computerized datebook shaped like a big birthday cake.</code>"</p>

<p>There are two objects of particular interest to be found in every MOO database:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#0</code> is The System Object. It is the only positive object (negative ones will be covered under Length 3) which is treated specially by the server.

<ul>
<li>Various verbs of #0 are called by the server when events happen, such as a player typing a line, the server starting or stopping, and so on. It is the job of these verbs to handle the event as necessary; thus, the database (and the verbs of #0 defined therein) define most of the behavior of the actual server.</li>
<li>Properties of #0 are used for a special syntax for referring to objects globally, without memorizing their object number. If <code>#0</code> has a property named "<code>foo</code>" set to <code>#1234</code>, <code>$foo</code> can be used anywhere to refer to <code>#1234</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>#1</code> is the Root Class, the parent of all other objects.
LambdaMOO (like JavaScript) uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming" rel="nofollow">prototypal inheritance</a> rather than the more common class-based inheritance. Every object has a parent, from which it inherits any properties and verbs that are not defined on itself. (#1 is the parent of both itself and #0.) #1 defines a few verbs and properties which should exist on every object, such as a name and description, as well as various verbs to handle events such as: creation and recycling; moving things into and out of the object; moving the object into and out of other objects; and handling user input and output.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<p>LambdaMOO uses negative object numbers to represent special things which do not actually exist, but which must have an object type so they can be manipulated in the same way as a normal object.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#-1</code> - <code>$nothing</code> - An object which is not. Most commonly seen in the context of object locations: all objects must have a location; objects which don't need to be inside of something else have their location set to <code>#-1</code>.</li>
<li><code>#-2</code> - <code>$ambiguous_match</code> - Used as a placeholder when the user's input could have matched multiple objects. For instance, "ball" in a room with a "red ball" and a "blue ball" will be represented as <code>#-2</code> (generally causing a "which did you mean?" error message).</li>
<li><code>#-3</code> - <code>$failed_match</code> - Used as a placeholder when the user's input couldn't be matched to any object. For instance, "ball" in a room which only contains a "red cube" and a "blue cube".  This generally causes an "I see no x here."-type message.</li>
<li><code>#-4</code> and below are used to represent players who have not logged in yet (that is, they're still at the login screen). These players need an object number so the code can interact with them, but can't be given a positive one because the server doesn't know who they are yet. When I log in, for instance, my connection might be given <code>#-6</code> until I log in, at which point the connection is re-associated with my actual player object, <code>#124434</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<p><code>verb</code>, <code>dobj</code>, <code>iobj</code>: When the user types in a command, it is split up according to the form <code><i>verb</i> [<i>direct-object</i> [<i>preposition</i> <i>indirect-object</i>]]</code>. (For example, <code>look</code>, <code>take ball</code>, <code>give ball to Henry</code>.)</p>

<p><code><i>direct-object</i></code> and <code><i>indirect-object</i></code> are matched to an actual object (or <code>#-1</code> or <code>#-2</code> if necessary) and <code><i>verb</i></code> is called on whichever object is found to have a matching one first. (It searches the player, the room, the direct object, and the indirect object, in that order.) That verb can then use the special variable <code>verb</code> to find out what it was called as (equivalent to <code>$0</code> in a bash script), and <code>dobj</code> and <code>iobj</code> to determine the objects that were matched to the direct and indirect objects. There are also special variables for the preposition, as well as the actual strings (rather than matched objects) for the direct and indirect objects.</p>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<p><code>1?2|3</code> - This is the syntax for the ternary conditional operator; in most c-type languages it would be <code>1?2:3</code> instead. There is no special type for binary values; rather, each possible value for each possible type is categorised as either true or false. True values are ints and floats other than <code>0</code> and non-empty strings and lists. Everything else is considered false, including <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>{}</code>, and all objects. Thus, <code>1?2|3</code> evaluates to <code>2</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 6</h2>

<p><code>player</code> is another special variable (like <code>dobj</code> et al), but it refers to the player object that executed the command. For instance, when I (#124434) type <code>pull lever on contraption</code>, the <code>contraption:pull</code> verb has the <code>player</code> variable set to #124434. This is most commonly used for output: the player has a <code>tell</code> verb which sends a line of text over the correct network connection to the person's computer, so they can read about the antics of the horde of lemmings they have just unleashed on an unsuspecting Barney.
(The Rube Goldberg Contraption has to be seen to be believed. Telnet to  lambda.moo.mud.org port 8888 and go southeast from the Living Room.)</p>

<h2>Length 7</h2>

<pre><code>"ab"[2]
</code></pre>

<p>Strings are represented with the usual double quotes, and list indexes are done with square brackets. Unlike many languages, lists and strings start indexing with 1 rather than 0. Thus, this expression returns <code>"b"</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 8</h2>

<p><code>#1:huh()</code> is the shortest verb call I could come up with. Verbs are the same as a method in most other languages; the syntax for calling them is <code>#nnn:verb([arguments...])</code>.</p>

<p>You wouldn't generally call <code>:huh()</code> directly; it is called by the default core when a player tries to do something to an object that the object doesn't support.
For instance, <code>globnitz ball</code> will look up <code>ball</code> (say it's #1234), discover that <code>#1234:globnitz</code> doesn't exist, and call <code>#1234:huh()</code> instead.
 The default implementation of <code>#1:huh</code> just tells the player <code>I don't understand that.</code></p>

<h2>Length 10</h2>

<pre><code>create(#1)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>create()</code> function call is used to create a new object. The argument is the parent object; <code>create()</code> then returns a new object which is a child of that object. (Some forks of the LambdaMOO server, such as <a href="http://stunt.io" rel="nofollow">stunt</a>, also support multiple inheritance. It works more or less as you would expect.)
Thus, this command creates a new object which inherits the properties and verbs of <code>#1</code>, described above.</p>

<p>Unlike most object-oriented programming languages, objects in LambdaMoo are not something you create very frequently. This is partly for technical reasons: there is generally a quota which limits the number of objects a player can own, to reduce database bloat. However, it is mostly because objects are very much a physical <em>thing</em> (inasmuch as anything can be physical in a virtual world). If you make an object, players can see it, pick it up and carry it around.</p>

<p>There are patches which you can apply to the LambdaMOO server to get something that resembles a traditional object; these are called "waifs" in LambdaMoo parlance. Waifs have properties and verbs but don't have object numbers, are automatically garbage-collected when they leave scope, and do not appear in the world. If you want to use these you will need to compile the server with the waif patches applied.</p>

<p>If your server has object recycling enabled, the object reference you get is not guaranteed to be unique: it may have been used by a different object in the past. When creating an object this is not an issue, since you have never heard of whatever it was before. However, you need to bear this in mind when using object numbers: <code>#1040</code> which used to be a vacuum cleaner may have been recycled into a tax form since you last used it. In practice, this is not usually a problem: just as you wouldn't throw out a perfectly good vacuum cleaner, you don't recycle a useful object. (I've found that you usually run into this problem only when you have a reference to something a different player owns, and that player is reaped: all of their objects get recycled.)</p>

<div id="pu190" class="pu"><h2>Burlesque</h2>

<p>Burlesque is a stack-based, lazy, concatenative esoteric programming language.
It was designed as a utility for students of computer science but it has become a language used for golfing. Since Burlesque has two character built-ins programs obviously grow twice as fast as programs in golfing languages with one character built-ins do. Burlesque is more like a command line utility tool for easy homework or related things like when you need to know what that number in base 4 is or what are the subsequences of this set or what are the permutations of this string and the like. </p>

<p>Burlesque has 400+ built-ins and growing. This also means that Burlesque's power stems from two main factors: The laziness and the amount of built-ins. The drawback is that the language is not very verbose and you can't infer what a code is doing by simply looking at the syntax and control structures since those don't really exist in Burlesque. The only way to understand Burlesque programs is by either looking everything up all the time or by memorizing a lot of built-ins. </p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Beam is a 2-dimensional language designed in 2010 by an Esolangs Wiki user named <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Feuermonster" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Feuermonster</a>, and was originally implemented in 2012. It was re-discovered by me while looking for an interesting language with which to answer the famous <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/q/55422/42545">&quot;Hello, World!&quot; catalog</a>. The official interpreter has been lost, but PPCG user <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/31347/mickyt">MickyT</a> has developed a <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/57190/42545">Stack Snippet interpreter</a>.</p>
<p>Beam is based off of three storage values:</p>
<ul>
<li>the beam, the primary storage; holds one unsigned 8-bit integer.</li>
<li>the store, the secondary storage; holds one unsigned 32-bit integer.</li>
<li>the memory, a (theoretically) infinite tape of unsigned 8-bit integers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>H
</code></pre>
<p>Yay, our first full program! Unfortunately, we can hardly do anything in just 1 byte. <code>H</code> simply halts execution of the program, so from this, we get no output at all.</p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>:H
</code></pre>
<p>Now we get a chance to see some output. <code>:</code> prints the value of the beam as a number, so this program outputs <code>0</code>. If we were to drop the <code>H</code>, it would still print <code>0</code>, but it would also give us the error message <code>Beam is lost in space</code>. This error occurs anytime the beam travels beyond the bounds of the program.</p>
<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>r@H
</code></pre>
<p>First lessons in inputting: <code>r</code> sets the beam to the char code of the next character in STDIN. <code>@</code> is like <code>:</code>, except that it outputs as a character instead of a number. All in all, this program outputs the next character from the input. Not that useful, but pretty decent for 3 bytes. ;)</p>
<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>

<p>Finally, a chance to use Beam's 2D instruction plane! Beam has four arrows <code>^v&lt;&gt;</code>, which set the direction of the beam, and four mirrors <code>\/|_</code>, which reflect the beam in another direction. It also has several conditional direction changers, which we'll get into in a little bit.</p>

<p>Here we demonstrate a few of the conditional statements. <code>)</code> and <code>(</code> change direction to left or right if the store &lt;&gt; 0. <code>!</code> and <code>?</code> reverse the flow direction depending of the value of the beam.  <code>n</code> and <code>u</code> change the flow direction to up or down if the beam != the store.<br>So in the snippet above, <code>)</code> does not change the direction since the store is 0, the flow continues through <code>n</code> as the beam and store are both 0.  <code>+</code> increments the beam. <code>!</code> reverses the flow since the beam is now 1. <code>+</code> the beam again.  <code>n</code> now changes the flow direction down since the beam is 2 while the store is still 0.  <code>H</code>alt the program.</p>
<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>
<pre><code>+P+:p:H

<p>Bit of a boring snippet, but it demonstrates the setting and retrieving of memory values.  <code>P</code> will set the memory at store position to the beam value.  <code>p</code> will set the beam to the value at the stores memory position.  In this example the beam is incremented to one.  Memory location 0(store) is set to 1(beam). The beam is incremented and the value printed.  Memory location 0 is retrieved into the beam and printed.

<p><strong>Factoid</strong><br>
Perl is a general-purpose, dynamic programming language. It was created by Larry Wall in 1987 and is still widely used today. Perl is not an acronym, but there are a couple of backronyms in place, such as <s>"Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister"</s> "Practical Extraction and Report Language".<br>
<strong>Snippet Length 1</strong><br>
<code>;</code><br>
In Perl, semicolons mark the end of a line. Because empty lines are ignored, this program simply exits without doing anything.<br>
<strong>Snippet Length 2</strong><br>
<code>1;</code><br>
<code>1</code> is a true value in Perl. In Perl modules, the code has to end with a true value, usually this (<a href="https://metacpan.org/source/MSCHWERN/AAAAAAAAA-1.01/aaa/AAAAAAAAA.pm#L105">or sometimes something rather silly</a>.)<br>
<strong>Snippet Length 3</strong><br>
<code>&amp;a;</code><br>
You're probably wondering: "What's that funky symbol doing there?" Well, in Perl, the <code>&amp;</code> symbol marks the beginning of a subroutine (also known as a function). This executes the subroutine <code>a</code> and quits.<br>
<strong>Snippet Length 4</strong><br>
<code>1+1;</code><br>
Any positive non-zero number is true in Perl, as well as almost any non-empty string. (<code>'0'</code> is false.) Since 1 + 1 = 2, and 2 is a positive number, this works just like the <code>1;</code> snippet.<br>
<strong>Length 5</strong><br>
<code>$_=3;</code><br>
This assigns a scalar variable in Perl. See that <code>$</code>? That's what makes it a scalar. This assigns <code>$_</code> with the value 3.<br>
<strong>Length 6</strong><br>
<code>print;</code><br>
There's something special about <code>$_</code>: it's Perl's default variable. Most times, if an argument is not given, it falls back to <code>$_</code>. This prints <code>3</code>, assuming you set a variable like in the length 5 snippet.
<strong>Length 7</strong><br>
<code>s/b/B/g</code><br>
What is THAT? Did I just take letters and add slashes? No, this is the substitution operator. What it does it is takes a little <code>b</code> and replaces it with a big <code>B</code>. The <code>/g</code> is for global, which tells it to do this for all matches. Of course, it's doing this on <code>$_</code>, Perl's default variable, but I'll show you how to do it properly later.<br>
<strong>Length 8</strong><br>
<code>@l=(3,4)</code><br>
This defines an array with the items <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> in it. An <code>@</code> makes it an array, just like <code>$</code> makes it a scalar. Note that <code>@_</code> is not Perl's default array.<br>
<strong>Length 9</strong><br>
<code>if(2&gt;1){}</code><br>
The <code>if</code> conditional works as you would expect it to in other languages. It checks if the statement inside the parentheses is true, and if it is, executes the code in the brackets (in this case, none.) Note that the brackets do not have to end with a semicolon.<br>
<strong>Length 10</strong><br>
<code>$o=`cat A`</code><br>
In Perl, backticks can be used to get the output of a command. Here, it gets the contents of the file "A" (from the <code>cat</code> command.)</p>

<p>This demonstrates the use of menus. The one above is quite useless, as it does nothing, but they can be used to navigate the different part of a program. The first argument is the menu title, followed by pairs of options (the string displayed followed by a 1- or 2-letter label). Here is a more intuitive example:</p>

<pre><code>Menu("CHOOSE VALUE","AREA",A,"CIRCUMFERENCE",C
Lbl A
Disp πR²

Lbl C
2πR
</code></pre>

<p><code>Lbl</code> can also be used for branching with <code>Goto</code>. Menus have some limitations that make them annoying to use, however: There can only be seven menu items, and each title can be at most fourteen characters, so the whole thing fits on one screen.</p>

<h3>Length 29 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>Real

<p><code>Real</code> (on by default) places the calculator in real number mode, so calculations involving complex numbers throw a <code>NONREAL ANS</code> error. When put in <code>a+bi</code> mode, the calculator displays answers as complex numbers if applicable, so the second example returns <code>4i</code>. <code>re^θi</code> mode uses polar instead of rectangular coordinates, so it outputs <code>4e^(1.570796327i)</code>.</p>

You can have 10 different equations graphed on the same plane, and there are many useful commands to find intersections, maxima, values of <em>x</em>, etc. Those equations look like this when graphed on a standard window:</p>

<h3>Length 13 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>dayOfWk(9,1,6
</code></pre>

<p>This finds the day of the week of January 6, 9 AD. The output is a number where 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, and so on. This particular date was a Tuesday, so the output is <code>3</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 12 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>Circle(1,3,5
</code></pre>

<p>The first of the basic drawing tools, this draws a circle on the graph with a center at (1,3) and a radius of 5.</p>

<h3>Length 11 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>randInt(0,8
</code></pre>

<p>This generates a (pseudo-)random integer between 0 and 8 inclusive. There is an optional third argument that tells how many integers to generate. There are several other random functions, including ones for normal and binomial distributions, one for a random matrix, and one for a randomly ordered list with no repetitions. <code>randInt</code> can be seeded by storing a number as <code>rand</code>: <code>2→rand</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 10 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>4&gt;5 or 2≠7
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have TI-BASIC's (in)equality and logic operators. The inequality statements evaluate first to <code>0 or 1</code>, and <code>or</code> returns true if either side is true, so this displays <code>1</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 9 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>.656▶F◀▶D
</code></pre>

<p>This can convert from decimal to fraction and vice versa, which is very useful. There are also dedicated <code>▶Frac</code> and <code>▶Dec</code> functions that only go one way. Prints <code>82/125</code> in this case.</p>

<h3>Length 8 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>lcm(14,6
</code></pre>

<p>This prints the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple" rel="noreferrer">least common multiple</a> of 14 and 6, which is 42.</p>

<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>getDate
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty self-explanatory, just prints the current system date as a list, in this case <code>{2015 1 19}</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 6 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>√({4,9
</code></pre>

<p>Arrays (or lists) are surrounded by braces and separated by commas. This is similar to the <code>map</code> function of many languages, where it iterates through each element of the list and applies the operation outside the braces to it, in this case square root, so the result is <code>{2 3}</code>. Note that closing parentheses are optional, so they will be omitted from now on.</p>

<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>4iii6
</code></pre>

<p>We've got a couple of cool things going on here. First, the real parts, 4 and 6 are multiplied, and then the imaginary parts are multiplied: <code>i^3</code>, or <code>-i</code>. These multiplied give <code>-24i</code>. This showcases funky-looking juxtaposition multiplication and TI-BASIC's handling of imaginary numbers.</p>

<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>8°5′

<p>This is 8 degrees, 5 arcminutes, which is converted to degrees as <code>8.0333</code>...</p>

<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>8→T
</code></pre>

<p>This shows how numbers can be stored as variables, which is somewhat unusual because the number goes first, followed by the store arrow, then the variable name. As mentioned in the factoid, <code>θ</code> (theta) can also be used as a variable, and variables can only be one uppercase letter.</p>

<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>4M
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly to Mathematica, you can multiply with juxtaposition, no <code>*</code> necessary. All variables are initialized to 0 by default, so this will output 0 unless you have stored something else to that variable (see snippet 3).</p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>e

<p>This is the constant for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)" rel="noreferrer">Euler's number</a>, which displays as <code>2.718281828</code>.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Variables can only store certain datatypes. For example, <code>A</code> – <code>Z</code> (and <code>&theta;</code>) store numerical values, <code>str0</code> – <code>str9</code> store strings, and <code>[A]</code> – <code>[J]</code> store matrices (2-dimensional arrays).</p>

<div id="pu194" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://catb0t.github.io/egshel">EGSHEL (the Extensible Golfing Scripting High Efficiency Language) v0.1</a></h1>

<p>Currently in development, EGSHEL is a highly extensible turing-complete object-oriented stack-aware scripting language intended mostly for golfing but which, especially due to a Pythonic module-importing structure, is designed to be useful in other ways, as a general purpose language. It's influenced by Pyth, <s>LOLCODE,</s> GolfScript, Python, BrainFuck, and more.
<br> Incidentally, its error-allowing parser and ignorance of unused or explicitly undefined characters make it very useful for polyglots with other, "real" languages like C, Python and Javascript.<br><br>
<strong>Factoid:</strong> <s>LOLScript</s> EGSHEL has two basic parser modes: Concise, which binds builtins to lowercase letters and makes everything tiny, and Verbose, the default, which can can parse Concise code but, as the name suggests, is less tiny and more readable.
The name EGSHEL is both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym">backronym</a> and intended to convey that due to implicit, inferential types and other such features.<br><br><s>Originally designated LOL<s>Golf</s> LOLScript, <s>it's clear from where LOLScript gets its name (which will probably change soon): LOLCODE.</s> I was trying to make a meaningful program for Mystery String Printer in less than 128 bytes but LC has more than that in boilerplate just to make a loop. <br>
(In practice, however, LS does not look or work at all remotely like LC. The first spec isn't even done but all we've copied from LC into LS so far is "vsb" to print strings (from LC's VISIBLE builtin.))</s>
<br><br></p>

<h2>1 Char:</h2>

<pre><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>A semicolon is not so interesting but extremely useful. It can turn lines that would otherwise need to end in a newline, into a continuous line, and when found after a statement within either the first or last 3 lines of the file, sets some interesting mode-related options.<br>
On its own line, though, it denotes the respective beginning or end of a readable file and if only one is found near either the top or bottom of the file, it gives execute precedence to that "side" of the file. <br>Execute precedence is something more easily explained with more chars but basically, it sets the initial reading direction: up or down the file.
<br> In Concise mode, since Concise programs are almost always one line, an otherwise unecessary leading or trailing semicolon denotes the left/right reading direction on a per-character basis. But, I need more votes to explain further.</p>

<h2>2 Chars:</h2>

<pre><code>-|
</code></pre>

<p>A hyphen directly followed by a vertical bar is, at least for now, a single line comment initiator in Verbose mode. <br> In Concise mode, unless the Concise code is embedded within a Verbose function or block, there are no comments and this denotes <s>something</s> nothing, yet. <br>
<br>
If a <code>-|</code> is found more two or more spaces after a valid grouping of characters on a line in a Concise block in an otherwise Verbose script, it is a single line comment.</p>

<h2>3 Chars:</h2>

<pre><code>1~B
</code></pre>

<p>Finally something unique! Take a guess as to what this does...
If you guessed that it results in the second last (zero-indexed) history index of  B, then you would be right!<br>
History indicies allow direct access to a given variable's given 0 (represented by a solo tilde preceding a var) - Fh-th previous value. <br>
What, you may ask, is the point? Well, as an example, when you use a similar statement <code>~1B</code>, the result is the two (0 &amp; 1) previous variables and B's current value concatenated based on their types. EGSHEL is dynamically typed and object-oriented thus it's up to the programmer to explicitly cast otherwise implicit types when needed. ~*B results in all previous values of B concatenated, incidentally.</p>

<h2>4 Chars</h2>

<pre><code>#0(y
</code></pre>

<p>Calls the first defined anonymous function in a file with y as an argument. functions are defined like <code>$foo(args{body}</code> but if you leave out the function name <em>foo</em>, it becomes anonymous, is put into a numbered list, and you must call it as above. normal functions are called with their name as expected: <code>foo(args</code>.</p>

<h2>5 Chars:</h2>

<pre><code>{:x:y}
</code></pre>

<p>Simple for loop, for <em>i</em> (that's i for Implied Imaginary) in x do y. More colons can expand  this into a first, second, third C-style loop.</p>

  <p>Haml (HTML abstraction markup language) is based on one primary principle: markup should be beautiful. It’s not just beauty for beauty’s sake either; Haml accelerates and simplifies template creation down to veritable haiku.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm partly doing this because I'm interested to see how many votes this could get around half a year after the original post ;)</p>

<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>%
</code></pre>

<p><code>%</code> is the tag marker for Haml. So if for example <code>%div</code> was used, it would result in <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>%a
</code></pre>

<p>As said above, <code>%</code> is the tag marker for Haml. So the <code>a</code> following the tag would tell Haml that it needs to create a set of tags with a inside like this: <code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag defines a hyperlink, which links pages and/or objects together.</p>

<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>%td
</code></pre>

<p>As above, this would form the tags for a table cell - <code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code>. Table Cells need to be prefaced by: 1) a Table tag <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, 2) The Table Body (this is optional) <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, 3) a Table Row <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>. You would end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;[Content Here]&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>.a I
</code></pre>

<p>As <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags are so common, you can leave them off in <code>Haml</code>. The <code>.</code> here indicates that the text that follows will be the <code>CSS Class</code> to apply, then the text after that is placed inside the div. So the above would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="a"&gt;I&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>

<pre><code>.a#bc
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>.</code> defines the <code>CSS Class</code> - as above - but the new feature here is the <code>#</code>. This defines the <code>CSS ID</code> of the element. So the above would equal:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="a" id="bc"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 6 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>.a Hi!
</code></pre>

<p>The second snippet that actually shows something!</p>

<p>Any plain text that comes after a class or id etc is the content for the tag. So the above code would result in:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="a"&gt;Hi!&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 7 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>%ul %li
</code></pre>

<p>Lists! The above is an unordered list (<code>%ul</code>) and then the list items are each specified as <code>%li</code>. So for the above to show something, we could do the following.</p>

<pre><code>%ul %li Number one! %li And Two!
</code></pre>

<p>This would result in:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Number One!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And Two!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 8 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>%p.a#b c
</code></pre>

<p>A paragraph! As before, the <code>%</code> indicates a HTML tag, so the above would be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="a" id="b"&gt;c&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A saving of 17 characters - 68% reduction :)</p>

<h3>Length 9 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>#a .b.c D
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>.</code> is the prefix for a css class, and to join two classes together, simply put the two classes without a space like above - <code>.b.c</code>. So the above equals</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="a"&gt;
  &lt;div class="b c"&gt;
    D
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 10 Snippet</h3>

<pre><code>:style=&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>To insert custom CSS to an element in html, you would generally use <code>style="&lt;!-- css here --&gt;"</code>. The Haml variant is as above. You would use it as below:</p>

<pre><code>%p{:style =&gt; "color: #fff;"} A Paragraph
</code></pre>

<p>Converted to HTML is becomes</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p style="color: #fff;"&gt;A Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>(<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/44749/21487">mbomb007</a>'s post already has a plethora of Python snippets, but I thought I'd chip in with some quirkier facts)</em></p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>Python is a dynamically typed language with an emphasis on readability.</p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>In Python 3, the above is equivalent to <code>True</code> in the sense that <code>1 == True</code> (and also <code>0 == False</code>). Note that this doesn't necessary hold true in Python 2, where you can <strong>redefine the value of <code>True</code></strong>.</p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> is an obsolete comparison operator equivalent to <code>!=</code>. It still works in Python 2 (although its use is discouraged), and was removed altogether from Python 3.</p>
<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>...
</code></pre>
<p>Python has a number of features which no builtin uses, but is there solely for the sake of third-party libraries. This <code>Ellipsis</code> object is one of them, and it is typically used for slicing. For example, if we have the following 3D <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" rel="noreferrer">numpy</a> array:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
</code></pre>
<p>then <code>a[..., 0]</code> (equivalent to <code>a[:,:,0]</code>) gives all the first elements:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>array([[1, 4], [7, 10]])
</code></pre>
<p>In Python 3 the <code>...</code> literal can be used outside of the slicing syntax, which amusingly allows you to use it as a &quot;to-do&quot; marker in place of <code>pass</code> or <code>NotImplemented</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def f(x):
    ... # TODO
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>(1,)
</code></pre>
<p>A one-element tuple in Python.</p>
<p>Python has lists (e.g. <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>) which are mutable, and tuples (e.g. <code>(1, 2, 3, 4)</code>) which are <em>im</em>mutable. One common use for tuples is as dictionary keys, since lists aren't hashable.</p>
<p>A common beginner mistake is to leave out the comma above, i.e. <code>(1)</code>, which is just the number 1 surrounded by parentheses. The one-element tuple is the only time you need a comma before the closing parens — it raises a <code>SyntaxError</code> if you try to put one in the empty tuple <code>()</code>, and is optional for tuples of length at least 2.</p>
<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>0or x
</code></pre>
<p>There's a few things going on in this snippet, so let's take a look!</p>
<p><code>or</code> is like <code>||</code> in many languages. In Python, <code>A or B</code> short-circuits, returning <code>A</code> (without evaluating <code>B</code>) if <code>A</code> is truthy, otherwise it returns <code>B</code>. For example, <code>1 or x</code> always returns <code>1</code>, as <code>1</code> is always truthy, and even works if <code>x</code> is not defined. On the other hand, <code>0 or x</code> either returns <code>x</code> if <code>x</code> is defined, or throws a <code>NameError</code> if it isn't.</p>
<p>When golfing, we can usually drop the whitespace between a number and an <code>or</code>, such as <code>1 or x</code> becoming <code>1or x</code>. This is possible because <code>1or</code> starts with a digit, making it an illegal Python identifier.</p>
<p><em>However</em> there is one exception — <code>0or</code>, which mysteriously throws a <code>SyntaxError</code>. Why? Because octal literals in Python start with <code>0o</code> (e.g. <code>0o20 == 16</code>), and the parser chokes when it reaches the <code>r</code>!</p>
<p><sup>Note: In Python 2, octal literals may also start with a leading zero, e.g. <code>020</code>.</sup></p>
<h3>Length 6 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>*x,y=L
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet demonstrates a special type of assignment in Python, where <code>L</code> is a list, tuple or any other sort of iterable.</p>
<p>In Python, you can &quot;unpack&quot; tuples and lists like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>a,b = [1,2]
</code></pre>
<p>This assigns 1 to <code>a</code> and 2 to <code>b</code>. This syntax is also used for multiple assignment, such as</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>a,b = b,a+b
</code></pre>
<p>which is useful when writing a program that computes the Fibonacci series.</p>
<p>If the lengths on both sides don't match, then a <code>ValueError</code> is thrown. However, Python 3 introduced a new syntax, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/" rel="noreferrer">extended iterable unpacking</a> (or more colloquially, &quot;starred assignment&quot;) which allows you to do things like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>*x,y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>This assigns <code>y</code> to the last element, 5, and <code>x</code> to <strong>the rest of the list</strong>, i.e. <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>. You can even do something like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>a,b,*c,d,e = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
</code></pre>
<p>which assigns 1 to <code>a</code>, 2 to <code>b</code>, <code>[3, 4, 5]</code> to <code>c</code>, 6 to <code>d</code> and 7 to <code>e</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>zip(*x)
</code></pre>
<p><code>zip</code> is a function which takes a bunch of lists and, well, zips them up:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
</code></pre>
<p><sup>Note: In Python 3 a <code>zip</code> object is returned instead, so if you want a list like above you'll need to wrap the call in <code>list()</code></sup></p>
<p>It's quite a convenient function if you have two or more related lists, and you want to link up their respective entries.</p>
<p>Now say you want to <em>unzip</em> the list — how would you do so? We can try to use <code>zip</code> again, but unfortunately this gives:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zip([(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)])
[((1, 4),), ((2, 5),), ((3, 6),)]
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that everything is in the one list, but <code>zip</code> takes the individual lists as separate function arguments. To fix this we introduce the <code>*</code> splat operator, which takes a list/tuple/etc. and unpacks them as function arguments:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>f(*[1,2]) ==&gt; f(1, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>And the result is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(*[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)])
[(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 8 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x='a''b'
</code></pre>
<p>The first time I saw this, I was a little taken back — what does it mean to have two strings next to each other? The answer was simple:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'ab'
</code></pre>
<p>Python merely concatenates the two strings! This is extremely useful for readability, since it allows you to break up long strings like so (note the surrounding parentheses):</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x = ('This is a very long sentence, which would not look very nice '
     'if you tried to fit it all on a single line.')
</code></pre>
<h3>Length 9 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>0!=2 is 2
</code></pre>
<p>You may already know that Python allows chaining of comparison operators, so <code>5 &lt; x &lt;= 7</code> is only true if <code>5 &lt; x</code> and <code>x &lt;= 7</code>. If you didn't know that... then surprise!</p>
<p>Anyhow, lesser known is the fact that, since <code>is</code>/<code>is not</code>/<code>in</code>/<code>not in</code> are also comparison operators, they can be chained too. In other words, the above code is equivalent to <code>(0 != 2) and (2 is 2)</code>, which is <code>True</code>.</p>
<p><sup>Note: There are a few subtleties with the <code>2 is 2</code> half though, since <code>is</code> checks whether two things are the same <em>object</em>, not whether two things are the same <em>value</em>. Python caches small integers so <code>1+1 is 2</code> is <code>True</code>, but <code>999+1 is 1000</code> is <strong><code>False</code></strong>!</sup></p>
<h3>Length 10 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x=[];x+=x,
</code></pre>
<p>What happens when you add a list to itself? If we try printing <code>x</code>, we get:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[[...]]
</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately, Python's <code>print</code> is intelligent enough to not explode trying to print recursive lists. We can then do a bunch of fun things, like:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x[0][0][0][0][0]
[[...]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[0] == x
True
</code></pre>
<p>This feature also works with dictionaries, and is one way of creating data structures with cycles, e.g. a graph.</p>
<h3>Length 11 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>help(slice)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>help</code> function is very useful for debugging in Python. When called with no arguments in REPL, <code>help()</code> starts a help session, in which you can look up documentation for functions/data types/etc. When called with a specific argument, <code>help</code> will give information on the related item.</p>
<p>For example, <code>help(slice)</code> gives the following information (truncated since it's quite long):</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>Help on class slice in module __builtin__:

class slice(object)
 |  slice(stop)
 |  slice(start, stop[, step])
 |  
 |  Create a slice object.  This is used for extended slicing (e.g. a[0:10:2]).
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __cmp__(...)
 |      x.__cmp__(y) &lt;==&gt; cmp(x,y)
 |  
 |  __getattribute__(...)
 |      x.__getattribute__('name') &lt;==&gt; x.name
 |
 | ...
</code></pre>
<p>As for <code>slice</code>, as we can see we can create <code>slice</code> objects for indexing. For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; L = list(range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; L[slice(2, 5)]         # L[2:5]
[2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; L[slice(2, None)]      # L[2:]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
</code></pre>
<p>Another useful function for debugging is <code>dir()</code>, which returns all names in the current scope when called without an argument, and returns all attributes of a given object when called with an argument.</p>
<h3>Length 12 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>round(5.0/2)
</code></pre>
<p>What does this evaluate to? The answer depends on your Python version!</p>
<p>In Python 2, division between two integers results in integer division (i.e. <code>5/2 == 2</code>) whereas in Python 3 we get float division (i.e. <code>5/2 == 2.5</code>). However, this is division between a float and an integer, which should always result in a float. Why would we get different results then?</p>
<p>If we take a look at the documentation for <code>round</code> for both Python versions, we'll find the answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#round" rel="noreferrer">Python 2</a>, <code>round</code> tiebreaks by rounding away from 0.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#round" rel="noreferrer">Python 3</a>, <code>round</code> tiebreaks by rounding towards the <strong>closest even integer</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <code>5.0/2 = 2.5</code> rounds to <code>3</code> in Python 2, but rounds to <code>2</code> in Python 3. Rounding towards the closest even integer might sound weird, but it's actually called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even" rel="noreferrer">banker's rounding</a>, and tries to treat positive and negative values similarly to reduce bias.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>class C:__x=1
</code></pre>
<p>Being object-oriented, Python has classes. The above is a class <code>C</code> which has a single attribute <code>__x</code> set to 1.</p>
<p>We can access class attributes using dot notation. For example, if we have the class</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>class MyClass(): my_attr = 42
</code></pre>
<p>then printing <code>MyClass.my_attr</code> would result in 42, as expected.</p>
<p>However, if we do the same and try to access <code>C.__x</code> as defined above, we get:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute '__x'
</code></pre>
<p>What's going on? <code>C</code> clearly has an <code>__x</code> attribute!</p>
<p>The reason is that attributes starting with <code>__</code> emulate &quot;private&quot; variables, something which <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1641219/does-python-have-private-variables-in-classes">Python does not have</a>. Python mangles the name of any attribute starting with <code>__</code>, appending the class name so that name reuse conflicts are avoided. In the above example, if we were really determined to access that <code>1</code>, we would instead have to do</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; C._C__x

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>NotImplemented
</code></pre>
<p>Not only does Python have classes, it also has operator overloading. For example, you can have a class</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>class Tiny():
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return True
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>__lt__</code> is the less-than operator. Now if we make an instance of <code>Tiny</code>, we can do this</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = Tiny()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t &lt; 1
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; t &lt; &quot;abc&quot;
True
</code></pre>
<p>since we've defined <code>__lt__</code> to always return <code>True</code>. Note that we can also do</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 42 &gt; t
True
</code></pre>
<p>but the following breaks:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t &gt; 42
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;pyshell#18&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    t &gt; 42
TypeError: unorderable types: Tiny() &gt; int()
</code></pre>
<p>Wait, how does that work? We haven't specified a behaviour for greater-than with <code>Tiny</code>, so it's not surprising that the last case breaks. But then how does an <code>int</code> (42) know that it's greater than our <code>Tiny</code> object?</p>
<p>Python has a builtin constant <code>NotImplemented</code>, which can be returned by a comparison special method. Let's try it out:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>class Unknown():
    def __gt__(self, other):
        # __gt__ for greater-than
        print(&quot;Called me first!&quot;)
        return NotImplemented
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we make an instance of our new class:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; u = Unknown()
</code></pre>
<p>We can do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t &lt; u
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; u &gt; t
Called me first!
True
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, what happened for <code>u &gt; t</code> is that Python tried to call the greater-than method for <code>Unknown</code> first, found that it was not implemented, and tried the less-than method for the other class (<code>Tiny</code>) instead!</p>
<h3>Length 15 snippet</h3>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x=[],;x[0]+=[1]

<p>This is a bit of a fun one. First we assign <code>x</code> to be <code>[],</code> which is an empty list inside a tuple, i.e. <code>([],)</code>. Then we do <code>x[0]+=[1]</code> which tries to extend the empty list inside by the second list <code>[1]</code>.</p>
<p>Now, remember that lists are mutable and tuples are <em>im</em>mutable – what happens when you try to change a mutable object inside an immutable object?</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x=[],;x[0]+=[1]

<p>Oh so it gives an error, I guess that's to be expected. But what if we try to print <code>x</code>?</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>@lru_cache(None)

<p>Just add cache! This is a simple example of a <a href="http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/" rel="noreferrer">decorator</a> available in Python 3.</p>
<p>Suppose we have the following naïve Fibonacci implementation:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def f(n):
    if n &lt; 2: return 1
    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)
</code></pre>
<p>As most introduction to programming courses may tell you, this is a <em>very bad</em> way of implementing Fibonacci, leading to exponential runtime since we're effectively just adding a lot of 1s at the base case. <code>f(10)</code>? Runs in a split second. <code>f(32)</code>? Take a while, but it gets there. <code>f(100)</code>? Nope.</p>
<p>But if we cache the results, things should get a lot faster. We could always use a dictionary for the cache, but let's try something else instead:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(None)
def f(n):
    if n &lt; 2: return 1
    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, all I've done is import <code>lru_cache</code> from the <code>functools</code> module and added <code>@lru_cache(None)</code> before my function. <code>@</code> denotes a decorator which wraps around a function, in this case for memoisation. <code>lru_cache</code>'s first argument is <code>maxsize</code>, the maximum size of the cache – here we've set it to <code>None</code> to indicate no maximum size.</p>
<p>Now if we try to use it:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f(100)
573147844013817084101
</code></pre>
<p>And it didn't even take a second!</p>
<p><sup>Note: <code>f(1000)</code> leads to a recursion depth error, but that's a story for another time</sup></p>

<pre class="lang-julia prettyprint-override"><code>@time 1

<p>Julia has built-in tools for profiling code. Among them are <code>@time</code> and <code>@allocated</code>, which are actually <a href="http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/#macros">macros</a>. Here we're using the former.</p>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the expression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the source code (at the time of writing):</p>

<pre class="lang-julia prettyprint-override"><code>macro time(ex)
    quote
        local b0 = gc_bytes()
        local t0 = time_ns()

        local nfs0 = gc_num_full_sweep()
        local val = $(esc(ex))
        local nfs1 = gc_num_full_sweep()

<p>So what happens when we time the integer 1 at a freshly opened REPL?</p>

<pre class="lang-julia prettyprint-override"><code>julia&gt; @time 1

</code></pre>

<p>13880 bytes allocated to print the number 1?! That seems a little excessive. But as it turns out, most of the allocation is due to the fact that Julia is JIT compiled. (Thanks to Martin Büttner for correcting me on the reason!) But if we were to run this again in the same session, we'd get something a little different:</p>

<pre class="lang-julia prettyprint-override"><code>julia&gt; @time 1

<p>The <code>≠</code> operator is equivalent to <code>!=</code>, i.e. "not equal to". You can write it like <code>≠(1, 0)</code> as in the snippet, or like <code>1 ≠ 0</code>. Since 1 is obviously not 0, this returns <code>true</code>.</p>

<h3>Factoid:</h3>
<p>x86 Machine Code is the assembled version of x86 Assembly that the processor actually runs. It was developed back when memory and storage space were expensive, and was designed to be somewhat backwards compatible all the way to the Intel 8008. Keeping executable code small was one of the goals, and it utilizes variable length instructions and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computing" rel="noreferrer" title="CISC architecture">CISC architecture</a> to help achieve this (which has had the drawback of making it more complicated to improve performance on modern processors). This, along with the bare-bones nature of assembly and machine code in general, gives x86 programs the ability to be extremely compact.</p>
<h3>Length 1:</h3>
<p>Now for the first program:</p>
<pre><code>0xC3
</code></pre>
<p>Open up a hex editor, enter that byte, and save it as test.com.</p>
<p>You now have valid MS-DOS program which immediately returns without doing anything, since 0xC3 is the instruction 'RET'. This does however show another interesting aspect for golfing with x86: the .com file format. This executable format has absolutely no header - the file is simply loaded into memory starting at address 0x100, and then execution is started at 0x100. This means no bytes wasted on metadata!</p>
<h3>Length 2:</h3>
<p>Our next program:</p>
<pre><code>0x4D 0x5A
</code></pre>
<p>or 'MZ' in ASCII.</p>
<p>Ok, I cheated a bit, that really isn't a useful program, since it corresponds to the instructions</p>
<pre><code>DEC     BP
POP     DX
</code></pre>
<p>Which aren't actually useful for starting a .com program. In fact, that's the whole point of those two values - no reasonable .com file should start with them! .com files were limited to 65280 bytes in size (64KiB - 0x100), so when larger programs started to be needed, a new format had to be developed. This was the .exe file format, which does have a header. However, MS-DOS needed to keep the .com extension on certain components for backwards compatibility, so it needed a way to detect whether a .com file was really an .exe. They chose the sting 'MZ' as this magic number, and to this day, if you open up a Windows .exe (or .dll) file in a hex editor, you'll see they start with those two bytes. It amuses me that even the most modern Windows program starts with a compatibility constraint from the 70's.</p>
<h3>Length 3:</h3>
<p>Now for an infinite loop:</p>
<pre><code>41 E2 FD
</code></pre>
<p>Which translates to</p>
<pre><code>start:
inc cx
loop start 
</code></pre>
<p>This program increments the value of CX (which will be &gt;0 to begin with), then executes the loop instruction. Loop is an excellent example of a CISC instruction since it combines 3 simple operations into one special-purpose operation: it decrements the value of CX, checks if it is 0, and jumps to the target label if not. There are also forms of loop that check other flags in addition to ending when CX is 0. We could have done just 'jump start' for a 2 byte infinite loop, but this was more interesting.</p>
<h3>Length 4:</h3>
<p>A program that is minimally useful:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Translated to assembly:</p>
<pre><code>inc ax    ; 1 byte
int 10h   ; 2 bytes
ret       ; 1 byte
</code></pre>
<p>This program sets the console to 40x25 characters, clears the screen, then returns to the command line. AX is set to the video mode we want (1), then the BIOS interrupt 10h is called to actually set the video mode &amp; clear the window, before returning. Expect to see more of these BIOS interrupts in the future.</p>
<h3>Length 5:</h3>
<p>We can now implement a pause program:</p>
<pre><code>B4 01 CD 21 C3

<p>Translated to assembly:</p>
<pre><code>mov ah,1  ; 2 bytes
int 21h   ; 2 bytes
ret       ; 1 byte
</code></pre>
<p>This program tells the BIOS to wait for a key to be pressed and echos it to the screen before returning. This also demonstrates how on the x86, some of the registers can be partially read or written. In this case, we set the top byte of AX (AH) to 1. On 32 bit processors, you can also operate on the low 16 bits without affecting the top 16 bits. This ability to modify partial registers can be handy for assembly programmers, but has drawbacks for modern processors trying to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution" rel="noreferrer">out-of-order execution</a>, since
they can introduce false data dependencies.</p>
<h3>Length 9:</h3>

<pre><code>; These two instructions set up ES, the 'extra segment'
push 0xb700 ; 3 bytes
pop  es     ; 1 byte

inc  ax     ; 1 byte
jns  label  ; 2 bytes, Jump Not Signed - Jump unless the sign flag is set (when inc AX yields 0x8000
ret         ; 1 byte
</code></pre>
<p>The output is the default character set repeated in different colors. The low byte of AX is the character code, and the high byte specifies the colors to use.
<img src="https://i.sstatic.net/ym5x0.png" alt="Default character set repeated in different colors" /></p>
<p>16 bit programs could only address up to 64KiB directly. To get around this, the x86 used 'segments' - special registers that would be multiplied by 16 and added to all memory accesses to give 20 bits of addressable memory. A program could change the values of these segment registers in order to access more memory - or special areas of memory: this program modifies the extra segment in order to write to video memory.
Different types of memory access used different segment registers, allowing code, data, and the stack to be accessible in different chunks of memory at the same time. The default segment could also be overridden for many instructions.</p>

<p>Floating point math on x86 systems was originally handled by the optional x87 co-processor, it wasn't until the 486 that it was moved onto the same chip. The x87 also had a rather different architecture, it was stack-based, with 8 80bit registers available. It also had a variety of rounding modes, precision, and maskable exceptions that could be set.</p>
<p>This program prints the values for seven constants baked into the processors. It may seem odd that instruction space would be wasted on simple constants like 0 and 1, but keep in mind that the instruction set was created when memory was small, and these instructions are typically 2 bytes smaller than equivalent operations. The program also uses an obscure instruction, FBSTP -'Store BCD Integer and Pop'. Back when the x86 was developed, operations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal" rel="noreferrer">BCD</a> numbers were more common, and the x86/x87 has several instructions specifically to simplify BCD math, such as the AAM 'ASCII Adjust for Multiple' instruction also used in the program.</p>
<p>In the unprotected memory model used by early x86 programs, there is no distinction between data and code. Because of this, it is easy to iterate through the sequentially encoded 'Load Constant' instructions by simply incrementing the appropriate value.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p>The Z80 is probably the most famous CPU developed by Zilog. The company Zilog was started by dissatisfied Intel employees and their first CPU, the aforementioned Z80, was fully compatible with Intel's 8080, as well as having its own set of extended instructions. This was a big selling point as it meant that CP/M (a very popular OS in its day, designed for the 8080) could be run on a computer using a Z80 CPU with no changes to the software.</p>
<h3>Length 1 snippet:</h3>
<pre><code>HEX Op code   Instruction name
-----------   ----------------
AF            XOR  A
</code></pre>
<p>Being an 8-bit processor, the Z80 has many 1-byte instructions of varying usefulness. On the surface this instruction would not seem to be particularly useful as what it does is calculate <code>A</code> XOR <code>A</code>, storing the result in <code>A</code>. However, since the result is always 0 and all other ways of setting <code>A</code> (the Z80's main register or <strong>A</strong>ccumulator) to 0 are longer than 1 byte, that makes this an interesting and useful instruction! It also has the side effects of setting the <code>Z</code> <strong>Z</strong>ero flag (to 1) and resetting the <code>C</code> <strong>C</strong>arry flag (to 0). If you don't mind losing the previous value in <code>A</code> this is also a shorter way of resetting <code>C</code>, although there are other non-destructive ways of resetting <code>C</code> in one byte. The more obvious way takes two bytes.</p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet:</h3>
<pre><code>HEX Op code   Instruction name
-----------   ----------------
10 nn         DJNZ n
</code></pre>
<p>This is a combination instruction. Its full name is <strong>D</strong>ecrement <strong>J</strong>ump <strong>N</strong>on <strong>Z</strong>ero. It combines Decrement B (<code>DEC B</code>) with Jump Relative Non Zero (<code>JR NZ, n</code>) for a saving of one byte (very important for code golf!) It is also 3 T-states faster than using the two instructions separately, the actual time taken being dependant on the CPU's speed, typically 4 MHz. There is no other register that can be used instead of B and the only test for the jump is NZ, making this instruction unique because most other instructions have &quot;siblings&quot; such as the 75 different 8-bit load (<code>LD</code>) instructions.</p>
<p>If the value stored in B (an 8-bit register) is zero after being decremented, the program jumps n bytes, where n is a signed 8-bit integer. This means n can be anywhere from -128 to 127. The closest analogy with higher languages is the FOR loop where the code is executed B times. If B already contains 0 the first time DJNZ is executed, B gets decremented to 0xFF (-1 / +255) resulting in the loop executing another 255 times.</p>
<p>The simplest form is <code>10 FE    # DJNZ -2</code> which jumps back two bytes (to itself) until B is zero. All this would do is make sure B is zero and delay the execution of the following code by an amount proportional to the initial value of B. Alternatively, the offset could be a positive amount, skipping the subsequent code the first B times. Interestingly, this instruction affects no flags, not even the Zero flag so extra size/time savings and/or more straightforward code can be obtained if it is wanted to pass the current value of Z to another part of the program.</p>
<h3>Length 3 snippet:</h3>
<pre><code>HEX Op code   Instruction name
-----------   ----------------
DD 77 nn      LD   (IX+n), A
</code></pre>
<p>This introduces one of the two 16-bit index registers: IX. IX and its sister register, IY, are used to address offsets from memory locations without having to change the value of the register. A one byte, signed offset is set in the code (<code>nn</code> in the HEX code above). This is useful if you are reading or writing several non-continuous bytes from a single offset or multiple offsets in sequence. What this particular instruction does is <strong>L</strong>oa<strong>D</strong> the 8-bit value at the memory address (IX+n) with the value in the A register.</p>
<p>All instructions that use the IX register are prefixed with <code>DD</code>. This actually just changes the following instruction to use IX instead of HL, and then reads an additional byte after the Op code if it is in indirect addressing mode (indicated by the use of parentheses in the instruction name). The instruction <code>77       # LD   (HL), A</code> is the same instruction, but using HL instead of an indexing register.</p>
<p>IX is always intended to be used as a 16-bit index register, however, there are several unofficial, undocumented codes that allow using it as two 8-bits registers, HX and HL, just like the regular 8-bit registers H and L.</p>
<h3>Length 4 snippet:</h3>
<pre><code>HEX Op code   Instruction name
-----------   ----------------
FD 36 nn xx   LD   (IY+n), x
</code></pre>
<p>There are very few 4-byte single instructions, all of which are similar in function and use one of the two index registers. This time I am using IY. All IY instructions are prefixed with <code>FD</code>. It is almost identical to the previous example but using a direct value instead of a register. It <strong>L</strong>oa<strong>D</strong>s the 8-bit value at the memory address (IY+n) with the value <code>x</code> in the last byte of the instruction. (Normally, this op-code would be written <code>LD   (IY+d), n</code> but I am avoiding using <code>d</code> to prevent confusion with the hex digit <code>D</code>.)</p>
<p>Because of the way that <code>DD</code> and <code>FD</code> work, you can actually chain any number of <code>DD</code> and <code>FD</code> bytes together. Only the last one will take effect, wasting both memory and clock cycles. For example, <code>FD FD DD AF</code> will set the current instruction to use IY instead of HL, then IY again, then IX, then ignore them all and execute <code>XOR A</code> (see the length 1 snippet). As you can see, although it produces valid code, it is only useful to prefix instructions with <code>DD</code> or <code>FD</code> if they normally use the HL register (or the H or L registers if you are using undocumented instructions). The CPU automatically resets to using the HL register instead of an index register after each instruction, whether or not an index register actually ended up getting used.</p>

20 FC         JR   NZ, -4
</code></pre>
<p>There are no single instructions longer than 4 bytes (except for the aforementioned wasteful instructions) so now I need to write mini programs! This snippet calculates the <em>n</em>th triangular number (mod 256 since these registers are 8-bit) from 1 to 256. On entry the B register contains <em>n</em>. On exit the A register contains the result, B contains 0, the Z flag is set, the other flags are corrupted (not guaranteed to stay unchanged, nor to hold useful values, although the value of each flag will be the same after every time this snippet is run; the values are not random and can be predetermined) and all other registers are preserved (unchanged). How can it calculate 256 since the largest 8-bit unsigned value is 255 and why doesn't it calculate 0?</p>
<p>It sets the A register to 0 (see the length 1 snippet), <strong>ADD</strong>s B to A, storing the result in A then <strong>DEC</strong>rements B. If the value of B is 0 <em>after</em> being decremented, then the Z flag is set. The last instruction <strong>J</strong>umps <strong>R</strong>elative to the current position if the Z flag is not set (<strong>N</strong>on-<strong>Z</strong>ero), i.e. if B is not 0. <code>FC</code> is treated as a signed value, so it jumps by -4 bytes from the end of the <code>JR   NZ, n</code> instruction if the condition is met. So, if B is already 0 upon entry, decrementing it will overflow and set it to 255, causing the snippet to loop 256 times. The largest value it can calculate without overflowing is <em>Tri</em>(22)=253. The result of the next value, <em>Tri</em>(23) is 20 because 276 doesn't fit in an 8-bit number.</p>

<div id="pu201" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://github.com/mbuettner/labyrinth">Labyrinth</a></h1>

<p>Labyrinth is my new two-dimensional programming language. I'm unreasonably proud of how it turned out, so I figured this would be a good place to introduce it and maybe popularise it a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong></p>

<p>Labyrinth is a 2D stack-based language without any control flow commands. Instead, control flow is determined by the layout of the source code, which is supposed to resemble a maze (hence the name).</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>'
</code></pre>

<p>Every command in Labyrinth is a single character and occupies a "cell" in the 2D source code. Let's start with the latest addition to the language, because it's useful during programming and because it let's me get some basics out of the way.</p>

<p>The command <code>'</code> is normally just a no-op, but when the interpreter is invoked with <code>-d</code> (debug mode), <code>'</code> prints debug information about the current state. This information includes the grid (i.e. the source code; we'll see later why this is useful), the position of the IP, the moving direction of the IP, as well as the stacks. This is all the state there is in Labyrinth.</p>

<p>What stacks? Labyrinth operates on two stacks, "main" and "auxiliary". They both initially hold an infinite amount of zeroes, and can hold arbitrary signed integers. I picture them with the tops facing each other, growing towards the centre, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>Main [ ... 0 0 1 3  |  -123 345 1 0 0 ... ] Auxiliary
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>...</code> represents the infinite amount of zeroes at the bottom. This is also how they are printed by <code>'</code> and how some operator symbols have been chosen.</p>

<p>One last detail: Labyrinth doesn't terminate unless the IP hits a specific command. In a 1-cell program, the IP will instead repeatedly execute that one cell. This means the above program is simply an infinite loop that never prints anything. If we switch on debug mode, the code will instead repeatedly print</p>

<pre><code>Grid:
'
Position: (0,0)
Direction: East
Main [   |   ] Auxiliary
</code></pre>

<p>Note that both stacks are currently empty (the infinite amount zeroes is, of course, not printed but implied).</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>

<p>What's this? <em>I don't know yet.</em> <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are the only two non-letter characters which don't have an assigned function yet (and letters won't get any). So currently these are "walls" just like spaces and letters. A program which consists only of walls is considered empty and terminates immediately.</p>

<p><strong>But:</strong> I am planning to add commands for these two characters eventually, and this snippet serves as a placeholder until then. <strong>I'm happy to receive suggestions</strong> what these two characters should do! If you have an idea let me know <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/the-nineteenth-byte">in The Nineteenth Byte</a> or the dedicated <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/27364/labyrinth">Labyrinth chat room</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet</strong></p>

<p>Okay, real code now...</p>

<pre><code>90.
</code></pre>

<p>Let's take a nap... this code prints an infinite stream of <code>ZZZZZZZ...</code>. There are two things of note here:</p>

<p>First, in languages where each character is a separate command you can often only push numbers in the range <code>0..9</code> and have to build larger numbers with arithmetic. This can get annoying, so in Labyrinth instead, a digit will multiply the top of the stack by 10 and then add itself. This lets you write out numbers in decimal in the code. <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Emmental">Emmental</a> has this feature as well. So <code>90</code> will actually create a 90 on the stack for <code>.</code> to print as the character <code>Z</code>.</p>

<p>Second, as opposed to many other 2D languages, the edges of Labyrinth's source code don't wrap around. So the IP hits a dead end after executing <code>.</code>. When this happens, the IP simply turns around and continues in the opposite direction. So the IP keeps bouncing back and forth in the source code, executing</p>

<pre><code>90.090.090.090.090...
</code></pre>

<p>and so on, repeatedly printing <code>Z</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>4!\@
</code></pre>

<p>Printing is important, so Labyrinth comes with two more commands in addition to <code>.</code>. <code>!</code> prints the integer value in decimal (as opposed to treating it as a character code). Note that it <em>doesn't</em> print a newline. But printing newlines is quite a common task, and having to do <code>_10.</code> each time is annoying, so there's <code>\</code> which just prints a single newline.</p>

<p>I'm also introducing <code>@</code> here. This terminates the program, so we don't have to keep writing infinitely-looping code. So this snippet happens to print its length <code>4</code>, a newline and then exits cleanly.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet</strong></p>

<p>I think we can spare a newline now:</p>

<pre><code>?
~!@
</code></pre>

<p><code>?</code> is the input-equivalent of <code>!</code>: it reads as many bytes from STDIN as it can to form a valid (signed) integer and pushes it onto the main stack.</p>

<p>Now the IP can't move to the right, because there's a wall there (spaces and letters except <code>v</code> are walls; the source code is implicitly padded to a rectangular area with spaces). However, the IP can move down so that's what it does. This is essentially the dead-end rule from snippet 3: if there is only one non-wall neighbour, move there. (From now on "neighbour" will always imply "non-wall neighbour").</p>

<p><code>~</code> computes the binary NOT of the top of the stack. The IP hits another wall. However, this time it's not a dead end. It doesn't have to turn around, but it can take a left turn, so that's what it does instead. <code>!</code> prints the newly computed value, <code>@</code> ends the program.</p>

<p>This turning behaviour is important, so here are the exact rules for when the current cell has exactly two neighbours:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the IP can keep moving straight ahead, it does.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the IP moves such that it doesn't reverse direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two rules allow the IP to follow any "corridors" of code, even around bends. There is one more subtle special case for two neighbours, but we'll get to that later.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>,)@
.(
</code></pre>

<p>Our first <em>real</em> program. Those 6 bytes implement <code>cat</code>. <code>,</code> is to <code>?</code> what <code>.</code> is to <code>!</code>: it reads a single byte from STDIN and pushes its value onto the stack. When we hit EOF, it pushes <code>-1</code> instead. I have borrowed <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> from CJam: they decrement and increment the top of the stack respectively.</p>

<p>But the most important thing about this snippet is what happens after the read byte has been incremented by <code>)</code>. This time, the current cell has three neighbours: the one we came from, one straight ahead (the <code>@</code>) and one which requires a right-turn (the <code>(</code>). So where do we go?</p>

<p>For these kinds of junctions (3 or 4 neighbours), the top of the main stack is examined (but not popped). If it's zero, the IP continues moving straight ahead. If the top value is negative, it takes a left-turn. If it's positive, it takes a right-turn. In the case of 3 neighbours, any of those decisions might hit a wall: in that case the opposite direction is picked. This little mechanic is <em>the</em> way to implement control flow in Labyrinth.</p>

<p>And what happens in this specific case? As long as we're reading bytes (which will be 0 or greater), the <code>)</code> increments the value to a positive number so we take a right turn. <code>(</code> decrements it back to its original value before it's printed with <code>.</code> and we move on to reading the next byte. At EOF, the <code>)</code> will increment the <code>-1</code> to <code>0</code>, so the IP moves straight ahead, leaves the loop, hits the <code>@</code> and terminates the program. Nifty, isn't it? :)</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;.$,23&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We've seen in 3 how we can write simple endless loops, but the problem is the IP bounces back and forth. Not every code can easily be written such that it will still do the right thing if ran as a palindrome. Can we write similarly simple (i.e. linear) loops which just run each command once per iteration, but still put them on a single line?</p>

<p>For that, let me give you a glimpse at Labyrinth's second major feature (the first being how control flow works). It has four commands <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>v</code> which can modify the source code at runtime. Each of them pops one value from the main stack and then rotates (i.e. shifts cyclically) a particular row or column of the grid by a single cell. If the IP is on the row or column that is being shifted, it moves with the shift, <em>potentially through the edges of the grid</em>. This shift does not affect the IP's current orientation, and the IP will still make its normal move afterwards. I'm not aware of any other language where source code manipulation works like this.</p>

<p>So let's look at this code again. We start on <code>&lt;</code>, which pops a <code>0</code> from main. The <code>0</code> indicates that the IP's own row is being shifted (to the left). So we get this code:</p>

<pre><code>.$,23&gt;&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the IP is now at the right end of the grid. It can only move left so it does. Next it hits <code>&gt;</code>, which shifts the source code back in place:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;.$,23&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The IP is <em>still</em> at the right end, moving left. Now it executes the actual content of the loop, <code>32,$.</code>: push a <code>32</code>, read a byte, bitwise XOR, write the byte.</p>

<p>What does this do? If the program receives a stream of letters on STDIN, it will change the case of each letter and print them to STDOUT. E.g. <code>abCdE</code> turns into <code>ABcDe</code>. If we reach EOF on STDIN the program will terminate with an error, but let's not worry about that.</p>

<p>I will try to show some more elaborate use of the grid rotation commands in later snippets.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>"
:-"
~"
</code></pre>

<p>You should actually consider this one a <em>snippet</em>, not a full program. Assume that the IP enters this from the top and will leave to the right. Let's see what it does:</p>

<p>As mentioned in the first snippet, <code>"</code> is a no-op. It can be used to lay out paths of the Labyrinth without affecting the stacks.</p>

<p><code>:</code> duplicates the top of the main stack. If that value is non-zero, the IP will take a left-turn towards the <code>-</code>, which subtracts the two values. Since they are both the same, this gives zero and the IP leaves the snippet to the right.</p>

<p>If the duplicated value is zero instead, the IP moves further down. <code>~</code> takes the bitwise NOT, turning <code>0</code> into <code>-1</code>. The IP then follows the bend through the no-op, onto the <code>-</code>. Now this computes <code>0 - (-1)</code>, i.e. <code>1</code>. The top of the stack is now positive and the IP takes a right-turn and leaves the snippet in the same direction as before.</p>

<p>In summary, this turns non-zero values into <code>0</code>, and zeroes into <code>1</code>. It is therefore a very compact implementation of logical NOT.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code> "
"_;
 ;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, consider this a snippet. The IP enters it from <em>either</em> the left <em>or</em> the top. </p>

<p>A well-known problem in 2D languages is the <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Wire-crossing_problem">wire-crossing problem</a>. While Labyrinth doesn't <em>need</em> wire-crossing (or source manipulation) to be Turing complete, being able to cross paths of the Labyrinth can be very helpful when laying out the code.</p>

<p>There are several ways to cross "wires" in Labyrinth, and this snippet is the simplest one. <code>_</code> pushes a zero onto the main stack (this command is also necessary to push new numbers on the stack, because all the digits, including <code>0</code> just change the value of the to of the stack). So no matter whether the IP enters from the left or the top, the main stack will hold a <code>0</code> when the IP reaches the intersection. This means the IP will travel straight ahead. <code>;</code> discards the top of the main stack, in order to return to the previous state.</p>

<p><strong>Length 10 snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>_v"
 "
 )"
</code></pre>

<p>Consider this a snippet, but be aware that the height of the full source code should not be greater than three lines. The snippet is entered at the top left (on the <code>_</code>, going east) and exited either at the top right or bottom right (going east). The snippet also assumes that there's a <code>0</code> on top of the main stack.</p>

<p>I mentioned in snippet 5 that there's one more case to be considered for control flow when the current cell has two neighbours. Let's see what happens here:</p>

<p>The <code>_</code> pushes another zero onto the stack. Now the stack rotation <code>v</code> pops that zero and shifts the current column down by one, taking the IP with it:</p>

<pre><code>_)"
 v
 ""
</code></pre>

<p>Now the IP is still facing east, and the current cell has two neighbours, above and below. This means the IP can neither move straight ahead, nor could it reverse its direction, so in principle both choices are valid. If the top of the main stack was non-zero, we'd apply the same rules as for three or four neighbours: for a negative value turn left (north), for a positive value turn right (south). But the top of the main stack <em>is</em> zero. In this particular case, the direction is chosen <em>randomly</em> (choosing uniformly between the two options). This is Labyrinth's built-in PRNG. It's quite tricky to use, because the required conditions on the IP can <em>only</em> be set up with the grid rotation commands, and it only makes a binary decision, but <a href="https://github.com/mbuettner/labyrinth/blob/master/examples/rng.lab">it can be used</a> to build up larger random numbers with some effort.</p>

<p>Now that the IP has chosen a random direction, what happens next? If it goes up, the zero on the stack is incremented to <code>1</code> and the IP takes a right turn and leaves the snippet at the top. If the IP went down instead, the zero remains unchanged and the IP leaves the snippet at the bottom. So this snippet can be used to either a) just generate a random bit on the stack or b) choose one of two execution paths at random (or both).</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Joe is a language I've been working on for some time. It was designed to make list mappings and interactions with functions and other lists implicit and powerful.</p>

<h3>Length 1</h3>

<p>In Joe, the result of the last expression of every line that isn't a function, is printed. Thus, the following program prints <code>1</code> and exits. Note: the code is indented by 3, output by 0.</p>

<pre><code>   1

<h3>Length 2</h3>

<p>Functions can take one or two arguments. If called with one argument, the argument appears on the right side of the function. Monadic R gives range from 0 to y, excluding.</p>

<pre><code>   R5
0 1 2 3 4
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<p>If a function is called with two arguments, they surround the function. Here we call R with arguments 2 and 7. Dyadic R gives range from x to y, inclusive.</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<p>Joe does have higher-order functions,  but they cannot be defined by the user. Not that you would want to.</p>

<pre><code>:/&gt;c
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>&gt;c</code> ("greater choose") is a function that returns the greater one of it's parameters  (<code>1&gt;c4</code> returns 4). <code>/</code> takes it and returns a function that applies the <code>&gt;c</code> between the items of it's arguments (think of rfold1). So, <code>/&gt;c</code> is a max function! <code>:</code> then saves it to name F. Let's test this out. </p>

<pre><code>   F1 2 3

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<p>Joe has some handy ways to control data flow. Let's see one of them.</p>

<pre><code>   O$rMH"Shelly""Leo""Mike"
Leo
Mike
Shelly

   O$rME"Shelly""Leo""Mike"
Mike
Leo
Shelly
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see two versions of a simple sorting function <code>O$rM&lt;rule&gt;</code>. The rule can basically be replaced by any function you want to. I'll use the <code>H</code>-rule (head) in the following explanation, which shows the steps taken to achieve this result.</p>

<p>To get the first letters from the strings for the sorting, we map head to them.</p>

<pre><code>   MH"Shelly""Leo""Mike"
SLM
</code></pre>

<p>We then want to pass this as the left parameter to the sorting function <code>O</code> and the original list as the right parameter. We can do this using tacit composition (you can find more on the matter in Joe's quick reference).</p>

<pre><code>   {MHOA)"Shelly""Leo""Mike"
Leo
Mike
Shelly
</code></pre>

<p>Because this is so common pattern, I've created a shorthand <code>$r</code> for it. <code>O$rMH</code> is equal to <code>{MHOA)</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 6</h3>

<p>Function composition is vital in Joe. It is the only way to create any kind of data flow. See, for example, a factorial function.</p>

<pre><code>/*-l1R
</code></pre>

<p>How does it work? The arguments are always passed to the rightmost function, from where they're cascaded back in the chain. <code>1R</code> gives a list from 1 to the argument (inclusive). <code>-l</code> removes all zeroes ("minus list"). This allows the function to work correctly when passed a zero. Lastly, <code>/*</code> multiplies all values together to create the result. Now, at this point the implicit looping capabilities of Joe start to pop in. Observe.</p>

<pre><code>   F:/*-l1R
   F5
120
   FR10
1 1 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 362880

Perhaps, but it illustrates an important concept in early versions of Fortran: all code other than labeled lines and comments had to begin on column 7.</p>

<p>Here is an example of FORTRAN 77 code that exemplifies this and a couple other concepts we've seen thus far:</p>

<p>Early versions of Fortran had no <code>character</code> type. To manipulate strings, one had to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollerith_constant">Hollerith constants</a>, which themselves are typeless but can be stored in numeric variables. Hollerith constants begin with the length of the string in bytes, then <code>H</code>, then the string contents.</p>

<p>In this example we have <code>12HPCG</code>, which allocates 12 bytes for the string <code>PCG</code>. Since we've allocated more than we've provided, the actual string that gets used is <code>"PCG         "</code>. In such situations, the provided string is left-justified within the field and padded with spaces to fill the allocated length.</p>

So if OpenMP isn't enabled, the compiler just sees this as a comment.</p>

<p>One of the most common uses of OpenMP in Fortran is the <code>parallel do</code> loop. A toy example:</p>

<pre><code>!$omp parallel do
do i = 1, n
    y(i) = 10*x(i) + 1

<p>You can then declare, assign, and access variables of this type.</p>

This declares <code>a</code> to be a fixed 8-byte real input that won't be returned. Note the colons separating the attributes from the variable. Now if you were to also declare a variable <code>b</code> that isn't an argument, it's just a plain old real, you can omit the colons: <code>real(8) b</code>.

<pre><code>^G2
</code></pre>

<p><code>^</code> on sequence, int, gives the cartesian product of the first argument with itself n times, where n is the second argument.</p>

<p>In this case, since <code>G</code> is the alphabet (<code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code>), <code>^G2</code> gives all 2 letter strings, <code>aa</code> through <code>zz</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 2:</h3>

<pre><code>lT
</code></pre>

<p><code>l</code>, while normaly serving as <code>len()</code>, can also be used as log base 2. Since <code>T</code> is the variable initialized to <code>10</code>, this prints <code>3.3219280948873626</code>, log base 2 of 10.</p>

<h3>Length 1:</h3>

<pre><code>H
</code></pre>

<p><code>H</code> is the empty dictionary (hash-table) in Pyth, and is the only way to get a dictionary in Pyth, short of using <code>v</code> (eval) or <code>$</code> (Python literal).</p>

<h3>Factoid:</h3>

<p>Pyth has no multi-character constructs other than literals. Also, Pyth compiles essentially one-to-one into Python.</p>

<div id="pu209" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a></h1>

<p>Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a programming language initially developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library.</p>

<pre><code>var x [9]int32
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of how to create an fixed array. You can access it use normal indexing operation <code>x[8]</code> for example. You can iterate any array or slice using <code>for-range</code> statement, for example:</p>

<pre><code>for index, value := range x { // value == x[index]
}
for index := range x {
}
for _, value := range x {
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 13</strong></p>

<pre><code>var x []int32
</code></pre>

<p>This is a longer example of <code>slice</code>, slice is a struct that stores current length, capacity and pointer to an array. to get the capacity you can use <code>cap(x)</code>, to get the current length of the slice, you can use <code>len(x)</code> function. To add an element to the last element you can use <code>x = append(x,data)</code> function, if capacity equal to the current length, it will copied to another array, and the slice points to that new array.</p>

<p><strong>Length 12</strong></p>

<pre><code>var x *int32
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of pointer variable, a pointer most useful to change a value that declared outside function, for example:</p>

<pre><code>func SquareIt(n *int32) {
  v := *n
  *n = v * v
}
</code></pre>

<p>This function would multiply a variable passed into it (you must prefix with <code>&amp;</code> when passing non-pointer into pointers), for example: </p>

<pre><code>y := int32(12)
SquareIt(&amp;y)
fmt.Println(y) // 144
</code></pre>

<p>A pointer also can be used to change function owner's member, for example:</p>

<pre><code>type Person struct {
   Age int
}
func (p Person) Aging1() { p.Age += 1 } // doesn't change the age
func (p *Person) Aging2() { p.Age += 1 } // change the age
func main() {
  me := Person{Age:28}
  me.Aging1() 
  fmt.Println(me.Age) // 28
  me.Aging2() 
  fmt.Println(me.Age) // 29
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>

<pre><code>interface{}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of a type that can hold anything. The <code>interface{}</code> translates to "any type that implements at minimum 0 function". Here's better use-case on how to use this keyword</p>

<pre><code>type Stringer interface {
  String() string
}
</code></pre>

<p>That snippet above means that <code>Stringer</code> is a type that could hold anything that already implements <code>String() string</code> function (function named <code>String</code> that returns a <code>string</code>), for <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/3Bi9YFPgJ6">example</a>:</p>

<pre><code>type Hooman struct {
  Name string
  Age int
}
func (h Hooman) String() string {
  return "I'm a hooman named " + h.Name + " " + strconv.Itoa(h.Age)
}
func main() {
  me := Hooman{}
  me.Name = "kis"
  me.Age = 28
  x := Stringer(me)
  fmt.Println(x.String()) // kis 28
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre><code>func X(){}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of how to create a function. This function named <code>X</code> that holds zero parameter and doesn't return anything. You can add parameters/arguments between the <code>()</code> and return type between the <code>){</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>func Add(a int, b int) int {
  return a + b
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or alternative syntax:</p>

<pre><code>func Add(a, b int) (c int) {
  c = a + b
  return
}
</code></pre>

<p>A function can have its own owner, this function often called method in another language, to set the ownership of a function, just type the owner between <code>func</code> and the function name, for example</p>

<pre><code>type Person struct {
  Name string
  Age  int
}
func (p Person) Print() {
  fmt.Println("I'm a person named " + p.Name)
}
func main() {
  me := Person{"kis",28}
  me.Print()
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>package X
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of the first statement that you must type to create a package/library. The library would be called <code>X</code>, all function, type, constants or variables that declared capitalized, can be accessed from another package by typing <code>X.The_name_of_the_function_or_type_or_constants_or_variables</code> after including the package folder using <code>import</code> keyword. Normally the folder name is equal to the package name, visit <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html">here</a> for more information about code organization.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>

<pre><code>[]int{3}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a slice that points to an array that contains an element with value <code>3</code>. To increase the slice you may want to use <code>append</code> function, for example: <code>x := []int{3}; x = append(x,7)</code>, now that slice will point to an array that have a value of <code>3</code> and <code>7</code>, that equals to <code>[]int{3,7}</code>, to get the length of that slice, use <code>len</code> function, to get the capacity of underlying array, use <code>cap</code> function.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>strconv
</code></pre>

<p>This is the name of standard library that useful to convert mostly anything from/to a string, for example:</p>

<pre><code>package main
import `strconv`
import `fmt`
func main() {
  fmt.Println(strconv.Itoa(1234) + ` is a string now`)
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>struct
</code></pre>

<p>Struct is a keyword to create a record or a new data structure, that compose another type, this is an example of how to create a new type called <code>Person</code></p>

<pre><code>type Person struct {
  Name string
  Age  int
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>[]int
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of <code>slice</code> data type, slice is a struct that have pointer to real array, a current length of the slice and capacity of that array. <a href="http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals">Slice</a> is just like a microscope that shows only a part or whole of original array.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>x:=3
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example for a shortcut to create a variable named <code>x</code> and initialize it with <code>int</code> value of <code>3</code>. The longer version to do the same thing is: <code>var x int = 3</code>. There's no need to add semicolon at the end of each statement.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>

<pre><code>1.2

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Lisp is defined by its unique parenthetical notation.</p>

<h3>Snippet (10 chars)</h3>

<pre><code>(+ 1 1 10)
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, I know I've been using <code>+</code> for a while now, but now this will show another side of it. One time, I showed <code>+</code> with 0 parameters, then 1, and now 3. This will return <code>12</code>.</p>

<h3>Snippet (6 chars)</h3>

<pre><code>(main)
</code></pre>

<p>If you're deciding to compile lisp, usually you would define the function <code>main</code>. This simply executes that. Otherwise it would throw an error.</p>

<h3>Snippet (5 chars)</h3>

<pre><code>(+ 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly to the three-character snippet, this adds one to nothing. It seems it should show an error, but instead, simply returns 1.</p>

<h3>Snippet (4 chars)</h3>

<pre><code>(ex)
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>ex</code> is a function not defined by default, the interpreter will throw an error.</p>

<h3>Snippet (3 chars)</h3>

<pre><code>(+)
</code></pre>

<p><code>+</code> is a function that adds all of the parameters. Because this is adding nothing to nothing, you would expect this to return an error or <code>nil</code>, but it actually returns zero.</p>

<h3>Snippet (2 chars)</h3>

<pre><code>()
</code></pre>

<p>This is the shortest functional snippet. It simply returns <code>nil</code>.</p>

<h3>Snippet (1 char)</h3>

<pre><code>;

<p>This does absolutely nothing. It is simply a comment. There is nothing that functions in Lisp that has less than two characters. (maybe reading the Factoid would help?)</p>

<div id="pu211" class="pu"><h1>MUMPS</h1>
<h3>Factiod</h3>
<p>MUMPS, or M or Cache, was a programming language created at the Massachusetts General Hospital. In fact, that's where the name come from. No, it doesn't come from an infectious disease. The name is an acronym--<strong>M</strong>assachusetts General Hospital <strong>U</strong>tility <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>S</strong>ystem.</p>
<p>One interesting piece about MUMPS is that there is no restriction on language specific keywords. Couple this with the fact that whitespace is somewhat important and you can easily make some big goofs in code.</p>
<h3>1 Character</h3>
<pre><code>Q
</code></pre>
<p>In MUMPS, it is possible to shorten most keywords down to a single letter. For instance, the <code>Q</code> command is short for <code>quit</code> and will terminate the program.</p>
<h3>2 Characters</h3>
<pre><code>$H
</code></pre>
<p><code>$H</code> will help you get the current time. This command returns the number of days since 31-DEC-1840 followed by a comma, followed by the number of seconds since midnight. So, calling <code>$H</code> at 5pm on 13-MAR-2015 would return <code>633624,61200</code></p>
<h3>3 Characters</h3>
<pre><code>N Q
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this will be interesting. At first glance, you would recognize the <code>Q</code> command from before. However, this is where MUMPS can break, easily. The <code>N</code> command is short for <code>new</code> and is used to initialize variables. Since all data in MUMPS is technically strings, no data types are needed. However, there are no reserved keywords, so we now have a variable called <code>Q</code>.</p>
<h3>4 Characters</h3>
<pre><code>W @Q
</code></pre>
<p>Now life is getting even more interesting. Let's set up the environment a little. First, you need to know that <code>W</code> is short for <code>write</code>. Think <code>print</code> and you're good. So, we have some variables defined as below:</p>
<pre><code>N Q,A
S Q=&quot;A&quot;
S A=&quot;B&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if we take the line above in our example, what do we write out? At first thought, maybe the answer is <code>A</code>. That would be wrong. The answer is <code>B</code>. That's because the <code>@</code> symbol is used for indirection, which allows you to reference variables by the name stored in a different variable. This is similar to reflection.</p>
<h3>5 Characters</h3>
<pre><code>2+3*9
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in any <em>normal</em> programming language, the expression above would evaluate to <code>29</code>. However, MUMPS is strictly <strong>left-to-right</strong>. This means that the expression above would evaluate to <code>45</code>. Liberal use of parentheses is recommended.</p>

<h3>Length 143 and 144 snippets</h3>

<p>Finally... I've been waiting for this for a while (and been golfing it for about as long, so I don't have to wait even longer). I mentioned earlier that you can also equations numerically, and that you can also solve differential equations. I wanted to show a non-trivial example of that.</p>

<p>Consider a double pendulum on a rod (i.e. a pendulum attached to another). Each rod has unit length and each of the two pendulum weights has unit mass. I've also used unit gravity to shorten the equation. The following 143-character snippet solves the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics" rel="noreferrer">Lagrangian equations of motion</a> for such a system (in terms of the pendulums' angles and angular momenta). A derivation can be found <a href="http://sophia.dtp.fmph.uniba.sk/~kovacik/doublePendulum.pdf" rel="noreferrer">in this PDF</a>, although it's a fairly straight-forward exercise if you're familiar with Lagrangian mechanics.</p>

<p>It's quite unreadable, because I had to golf it down a lot:</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>d=θ@t-φ@t;NDSolve[{#''@t==-#4#2''[t]Cos@d-##3#2'@t^2Sin@d-Sin@#@t&amp;@@@{{θ,φ,1,.5},{φ,θ,-1,1}},θ@0==2,φ@0==1,θ'@t==φ'@t==0/.t-&gt;0},{θ,φ},{t,0,60}]
</code></pre>

<p>What's neat is that Mathematica immediately displays a miniature plot of what the solutions roughly look like:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/61C0c.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Okay, but that's a bit lame. We want to know what the motion of the pendula actually looks like. So here is a 144-character snippet, which animates the pendula while tracing out the trajectory of the lower pendulum:</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Graphics@{Line@{{0,0},p=θ~(h={Sin@#@#2,-Cos@#@#2}&amp;)~t,p+φ~h~t},White,{0,0}~Circle~2.2}~Show~ParametricPlot[θ~h~u+φ~h~u,{u,0,t}]~Animate~{t,0,60}
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting animation looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/3WS9q.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p><sup>I had to cheat slightly: if you plot beyond <code>t = 30</code>, the <code>ParametricPlot</code> by default uses too few plot points and the line becomes quite jagged. But most of the interesting dynamics happen after that time, so I used the option <code>PlotPoints -&gt; 200</code> to make the second half of the animation looks smoother. It's nothing substantially different, and the first half would look indistinguishable anyway.</sup></p>

<p>I think this will be my last snippet, unless I come up with something really mindblowing. Hope you enjoyed this!</p>

<h3>Length 100 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>GeoGraphics[{GeoStyling[Opacity[0.5]], NightHemisphere[]}, GeoBackground -&gt; GeoStyling["ReliefMap"]]

<p>I was thinking about some nice <code>Geo</code> functions for the 100 snippet, but ultimately I found something really nifty on <a href="https://twitter.com/wolframtap/status/559290929316909056/photo/1" rel="noreferrer">Tweet-a-Program</a>, which I just had to steal. The above generates a very nice looking sun map of the Earth for the current time and day, by overlaying a semi-opaque shape of the night hemisphere over a relief map:</p>

<h3>Length 81 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>CellularAutomaton[{{0,2,3,If[0&lt;Count[#,1,2]&lt;3,1,3]}[[#[[2,2]]+1]]&amp;,{},{1,1}},i,n]
</code></pre>

<p>I promise that's the last cellular automaton. But that right there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld" rel="noreferrer">Wireworld</a> in 81 characters. This time I didn't encode the rule in a single number, a) because I think it would be ridiculously huge (I didn't bother figuring it out) and b) to show you yet another usage of <code>CellularAutomaton</code>. This time, the rule is simply specified as a pure function, which receives a cells neighbourhood and returns the cell's new value. This is a much more feasible approach for cellular automata with more than 2 colours/states.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've set up the example from Wikipedia in <code>i</code> (two clocks generating signals, and a XOR gate) and let it run for some 50 steps:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/yMhPe.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>If you're interested, the actual plotting and animation could have been snippet 77:</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>ListAnimate[ArrayPlot[#,ColorRules-&gt;{0-&gt;Black,1-&gt;Blue,2-&gt;Red,3-&gt;Yellow}]&amp;/@w]

</code></pre>

<p>Back to something useful. Apart from normal systems of equations, Mathematica can also solve systems of differential equations. The above is technically just one differential equation with boundary conditions, but you can also supply that as a system of three equations. Similar to the integrating functions <code>DSolve</code> is for exact solutions whereas <code>NDSolve</code> will solve the system numerically. The above yields a single solution</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>{{R[r] -&gt; 1/2 r^(-(1/2) - Sqrt[5]/2) (1 - Sqrt[5] + r^Sqrt[5] + Sqrt[5] r^Sqrt[5])}}
</code></pre>

<p>which could now be easily used for further computations or plotted.</p>

<h3>Length 64 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>CellularAutomaton[{224,{2,{{2,2,2},{2,1,2},{2,2,2}}},{1,1}},i,n]
</code></pre>

<p>I promised you more <code>CellularAutomaton</code> magic! This snippet computes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Life" rel="noreferrer">Conways' Game of Life</a> with initial condition <code>i</code> for <code>n</code> steps and gives you the result for all intermediate timesteps.</p>

<p>A few words about the parameters: <code>2</code> is the number of cell states. <code>{{2,2,2},{2,1,2},{2,2,2}}</code> gives the weights for the 9 cells in the 3x3 neighbourhood. It ensures that the cell itself is distinguishable from the sum of the 8 neighbours. <code>{1,1}</code> says that the CA rule depends on cells 1 step away in either direction. Finally, <code>224</code> is the actual updating rule encoded in a single number. Figuring out this number can be a bit tricky, but there's a <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/CellularAutomata.html" rel="noreferrer">fairly useful tutorial in the documentation</a>. For more complicated automata, a single number won't cut it (because the number would be huge). Maybe we'll get there tomorrow! ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, if I feed a random grid into <code>i</code> and 200 into <code>n</code>, and send the result through an animated <code>ArrayPlot</code>, we can see that it's actually working:</p>

<p>Remember the polar plot from snippet 26? We can do the same thing in 3D! (In fact, there are two functions: <code>RevolutionPlot3D</code> for cylindrical polars and <code>SphericalPlot3D</code> for spherical polars.) Just like <code>Graphics3D</code> all three-dimensional plots are automatically rotatable in Mathematica, so you don't have to worry about a good camera angle upfront. The above plots something like a spherical harmonic (not quite though) and looks like:</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Manipulate[Plot[x^2a+x*b,{x,-3,3}],{a,.1,3},{b,0,3}]
</code></pre>

<p>This one is pretty nifty. <code>Manipulate</code> takes <em>any</em> expression, parameterises it with a bunch of variables, and then gives you a widget, where you can tweak the parameters and see live how the expression changes. As an expression you'll usually have some kind of plot. This is particularly useful if you're using Mathematica in lectures to demonstrate how families of solutions respond to modifying the parameters. The above shows how the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> coefficients scale and shift a parabola:</p>

<h3>Length 44 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>ArrayPlot@CellularAutomaton[110,{{1},0},100]
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I've got enough characters to use <code>CellularAutomaton</code> and also render the result. :) As far as I'm aware, <code>CellularAutomaton</code> is the only function in Mathematica related to CAs. But Stephen Wolfram seems to consider himself number-one guy when it comes to cellular automata, so this function is incredibly powerful. The above shows pretty much its simplest usage. This simulates a 1D cellular automaton for 100 steps - and it will actually return the state of the automaton at each of those steps, so the result is two-dimensional. The rule is the first parameter, which can either be specified in detail via lists, or just encoded in a single number. For this example, I've chosen the rather famous, Turing complete, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110" rel="noreferrer">Rule 110</a>. <code>{{1},0}</code> defines the initial condition: a single <code>1</code> in front of a background of zeroes. Maybe I'll show off some more features of <code>CellularAutomaton</code> in the future when I've got more characters available: it can simulate CAs in higher dimensions, using larger neighbourhoods and with more than two states.</p>

<p><code>ArrayPlot</code> is another nice plotting utility which just plots a 2D list as a grid of solid colours indicating their value. In the simplest case, <code>0</code> is mappend to white and <code>1</code> to black. The result of the snippet is:</p>

<p>It's been a while since I mentioned graphs. There a lot of common graph theoretical problems built-in Mathematica, along with nice visualisation tools. The above, for a given <code>graph</code>, will find a minimal vertex cover of the graph, and then render the graph with those vertices highlighed. E.g. if <code>graph</code> is <code>PetersenGraph[7,2]</code> back from snippet 18, we get:</p>

<p>It's pretty simple to animate things in Mathematica (and they don't even have to be images). You just give it the expression to be evaluated for each frame and a bunch of parameters that should vary over the frames. The above simply animates a plot of a moving sine wave. The animation will look something like the following GIF:</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>SortBy[PlanetData[#, "EscapeVelocity"]&amp;]
</code></pre>

<p><code>SortBy</code> does what you expect: it sorts a list based on values obtained by mapping a given function onto each list element. But wait, the above call doesn't contain a list at all. Since Mathematica 10, there is support for <em>currying</em> or <em>partial application</em> for some functions. This is not a language feature like in the more purist functional languages, but is just implemented manually for a whole bunch of functions where this is often useful. It means that the above snippet returns a new function, which <em>only</em> takes a list and then sorts by the given function. This can be very useful if this sorting order is something you'll use more often throughout your code.</p>

<p>And yes, there's another nice <code>*Data</code> function - the above will sort planet names by the planets' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity" rel="noreferrer">escape velocities</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 39 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>f[1]=1
f[2]=1
f[n_]:=f[n]=f[n-1]+f[n-2]
</code></pre>

<p>I promised to make the Fibonacci function more efficient. This snippet shows how trivial memoisation is in Mathematica. Note that all that's changed is an additional <code>f[n]=</code> in the third line. So when <code>f</code> is called for a new value (say <code>f[3]</code>), then <code>f[3]=f[3-1]+f[3-2]</code> will be evaluated. This computes <code>f[2]+f[1]</code>, then assigns it to <code>f[3]</code> (with <code>=</code>, not with <code>:=</code>!), and ultimately returns the value for our initial call. So calling this function adds a new definition for this value, which is obviously more specific than the general rule - and hence will be used for all future calls to <code>f</code> with that value.</p>

<p>Remember that the other Fibonacci function took 4 seconds for 30 values? This needs 3 seconds for 300,000 values.</p>

<h3>Length 37 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>l//.{a___,x_,b___,x_,c___}:&gt;{a,x,b,c}
</code></pre>

<p>In the last snippet I mentioned patterns. These are most often used in <em>rules</em>, which (among other things) can be used to modify structures which match a certain pattern. So let's look at this snippet.</p>

<p><code>{a___,x_,b___,x_,c___}:&gt;{a,x,b,c}</code> is a rule. <code>x_</code> with a single underscore is a pattern which refers to a single arbitrary value (which could itself be a list or similar). <code>a___</code> is a <em>sequence</em> pattern (see also snippet 15), which refers to a sequence of 0 or more values. Note that I'm using <code>x_</code> twice, which means that those two parts of the list have to be the same value. So this pattern matches any list which contains a value twice, calls that element <code>x</code> and calls the three sequences around those two elements <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>. This is replaced by <code>{a,x,b,c}</code> - that is the second <code>x</code> is dropped.</p>

<p>Now <code>//.</code> will apply a rule until the pattern does not match any more. So the above snippet removes all duplicates from a list <code>l</code>. However, it's a bit more powerful than that: <code>//.</code> applies the rule at all levels. So if <code>l</code> itself contains lists (to any depth), duplicates from those sublists will also be removed.</p>

<h3>Length 36 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>f[1]=1
f[2]=1
f[n_]:=f[n-1] + f[n-2]
</code></pre>

<p>Time for new language features! Mathematica has a few nice things about defining functions. For a start, you can supply multiple function definitions for the same name, for different numbers or types of arguments. You can use <em>patterns</em> to describe which sorts of arguments a definition applies to. Furthermore, you can even add definitions for single values. Mathematica will then pick the most specific applicable definition for any function call, and leave undefined calls unevaluated. This allows (among other things) to write recursive functions in a much more natural way than using an <code>If</code> switch for the base case.</p>

<p>Another thing to note about the above snippet is that I'm using both <code>=</code> and <code>:=</code>. The difference is that the right-hand side of <code>=</code> is evaluated only once, at the time of the definition, whereas <code>:=</code> is re-evaluated each time the left-hand side is referred to. In fact <code>:=</code> even works when assigning variables, which will then have a dynamic value.</p>

<p>So the above, of course, is just a Fibonacci function. And a very inefficient one at that. Computing the first 30 numbers takes some 4 seconds on my machine. We'll see shortly how we can improve the performance without even having to get rid of the recursive definition.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>A very neat plot, which outputs the streamlines of a 2D vector field. This is similar to a normal vector plot, in that each arrow is tangent to the vector field. However, the arrows aren't placed on a fix grid but joined up into lines (the streamlines). The significance of these lines is that they indicate the trajectory of a particle (in a fluid, say) if the vector field was a velocity field. The above input looks like:</p>

<p>Thanks to benwaffle for this idea. <code>CurrentImage[]</code> loads the current image of your webcam. <code>EdgeDetect</code> turns an image into a black-and-white image where edges are white and the rest is black (see snippet 45 for an example). The real fun comes with <code>Dynamic</code> which makes the expression update itself. So the result of this will actually stream pictures from your webcam and do live edge detection on them.</p>

The above is just one of the shortest you can get with <code>Sun</code>, <code>Star</code> and <code>Age</code> all being pretty short, because I couldn't wait to show this feature.</p>

<h3>Length 15 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>{##4,#,#2,#3}&amp;
</code></pre>

<p>This shows two of the more powerful features (and also useful ones for golfing). The entire thing is an unnamed <em>pure function</em>, comparable with <code>lambda</code>s in Python, or Procs in Ruby. Pure function are simply terminated by a <code>&amp;</code>. This operator has very low precedence, so that it usually includes almost everything left of it. The arguments of a pure function are referred to with <code>#</code>, sometimes followed by other things. The first argument is <code>#</code> or <code>#1</code>, the second is <code>#2</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>The other feature is <code>Sequence</code>s. These are basically like splats in other languages. A sequence is like list without the list around it - it's literally just a sequence of values, which can be used in lists, function arguments etc. <code>##</code> in particular is a sequence of all pure-function arguments. <code>##2</code> is a sequence of all arguments starting from the second. So if we named the above function <code>f</code>, and called it like</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>f[1,2,3,4,5]
</code></pre>

<p>We would get</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>{4,5,1,2,3}

<p>so the function rotates the input arguments 3 elements to the left. Note that <code>##4</code> referred to <code>4,5</code> which were flattened into the list.</p>

<p>Mathematica doesn't just have a built-in factorial operator <code>!</code>, it also has a double factorial <code>!!</code> (which multiplies every other number from <code>n</code> down to <code>1</code>). Furthermore, it supports arbitrary-precision integers. The <code>43!!</code> will be evaluated exactly, down to the last digit. Furthermore, rational numbers will also be evaluated exactly. So, since both numerator and denominator in there are integers, Mathematica will reduce the fractions as far as possible and then present you with</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>128/198893132162463319205625

<p>Of course, you can use floats whenever you want, but in general, if your input doesn't contain floats, your result will be exact.</p>

<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>Here

<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>3x

<p>Multiplication via juxtaposition! If it's clear that an identifier ends and another begins, you don't need a <code>*</code> or even whitespace to multiply them together.

<div id="pu213" class="pu"><h1>Powershell</h1>

<h2>Factoid:</h2>

<p>As part of Microsoft's "Common Engineering Criteria" Powershell is designed to provide an automation platform and unify the management experience across all MS Server products. It leverages both the command line strength of a robust shell and the object awareness of the .NET infrastructure. </p>

<p>To handle a highly complex environments the standard naming convention for Powershell commands and functions follow a Verb-Noun structure (ex. <code>Get-Help</code>). This means that in favor of clarity and readability long names are actually encouraged. However because this is a "working admin's shell" there are 2 tools that keep this from being a burden. The first is "tab completion" for commands, parameters, filenames, etc. The second is a robust alias structure, many of these examples will feature aliases.</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>|
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pipe</strong> Piping is a common feature in Shells. Powershell improves on this by piping objects instead of strings.
So if (for example) a command selecting a file is on the left side of the pipe, then all of the complex attributes {Full path, directory, CreationTime, etc.} of that file are available on the right side of the pipe.</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>gm
</code></pre>

<p><strong>gm</strong> is an alias for <code>Get-Member</code> which presents the various properties and methods that are available for an object. The most common of usage will be following a pipe.
Using <code>gm</code> on a file reveals 24 methods and 21 properties native to the <code>System.IO.FileInfo</code> object type.
<code>gm</code> is one of "the 3 things that reveal everything in Powershell" if you know only these 3 things you can use them to discover every function available.</p>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<pre><code>gci
</code></pre>

<p><strong>gci</strong> alias for <code>Get-ChildItem</code> (other aliases are <code>dir</code> and <code>ls</code>). In it's simplest sense <code>gci</code> retrieves the contents of a directory; you can apply filters, selectively recurse, and do everything that the DOS and Bash equivalents can.
The real power though is that Get-ChildItem has the ability to navigate <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847791.aspx">"Powershell Providers."</a> Providers exist for Environment Variables, the Registry, Certificates, and VM datastores; meaning that once you connect to the provider you can browse and interact with these abstract environments using familiar command-line navigation and logic.</p>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<pre><code>help
</code></pre>

<p><strong>help</strong> alias for <code>Get-Help</code>, and the second of "the three things that reveal everything". 
Help reveals structure, syntax, and function. For "professional" cmdlets and modules examples will be included. However help is dynamically aware of what's going on, so even for the most slapped together amateur functions you can use <code>get-help</code> to see the basic parameters and syntax.</p>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<pre><code>h |fl
</code></pre>

<p>This is the first example that is not just a component but is actually full, complete, and practical in daily usage without any further parameters or modifications.</p>

<p><strong>h</strong> alias for <code>Get-History</code>. Session History automatically logs your commands, and you can bring up recent commands with the up arrow. However to get a complete picture of command history use Get-History to present this array of information.</p>

<p><strong>|</strong> pipe, in this case we are piping an array of HistoryInfo objects. (note: space before or after a pipe is optional... but it sure makes examples more readable. So this could also be a length 4 example. Working from the command line I tend to insert a space before as an old habit.)</p>

<p><strong>fl</strong> is an alias for <code>Format-List</code>. Commands beginning with <code>Format-</code> are display options, no data is manipulated. Format-List accepts the piped input and displays the properties (for each array item) as a separate line.
This helps to quickly expose statistics like <code>ExecutionStatus</code>, <code>StartExecutionTime</code>, and <code>EndExecutionTime</code> for each history item. </p>

<h2>Length 6</h2>

<pre><code>(h)[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very simple demonstration of some complex concepts.</p>

<p><strong>h</strong> as we've already covered is an alias for the <code>Get-History</code> Cmdlet. This Cmdlet returns an array of objects.</p>

<p><strong>( )</strong> brackets in an expression like this work like in a math formulas, you process what's inside the brackets to get the result before other operations are performed. So by using <code>(h)</code> or <code>(get-history)</code> we are designating that things outside the brackets will not be interacting with the command itself, but with the resulting array.</p>

<p><strong>[0]</strong> this shows a way of directly specifying one element within an array, following standard comp-sci usage 0 represents the "first" element in that array. This example returns element 0 of the array returned by (Get-History). This can be useful when you want to systematically retrieve the Nth element of a sorted array, change the Nth letter of a string, or change the Nth octet of an IP address.</p>

<h2>Length 7</h2>

<pre><code>-Whatif
</code></pre>

<p><strong>-Whatif</strong> is a "common parameter" enabling a safety routine within Powershell. Get-Help states: "When a cmdlet supports WhatIf, the cmdlet reports the expected effect of the command, instead of executing the command."</p>

<p>So if you have generated a list of files stored in the variable <code>$deletePending</code> and your next step is to run <code>$deletePending | Remove-item</code> if you want to make sure that a typo isn't going to ruin your week you can run a simulation of that command <code>$deletePending | Remove-item -whatif</code>  Each simulated step will output a line similar to:</p>

<pre><code>What if: Performing operation "Remove file" on Target "C:\folder\file.tmp".
</code></pre>

<p>You can also turn WhatIf on for an entire session if you want to do extensive testing.
Most native "danger zone" cmdlets support the WhatIf parameter, and support can be integrated into your custom functions.</p>

<h2>Length 8</h2>

<pre><code>if(h){h}
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates the logical flow "IF the statement inside the brackets resolves to a Binary True, then run the statement in the curly brackets." It's important to understand that a Binary True ($true) can be achieved in multiple ways. Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>if ($True)        if (1 -eq 1)        if (Get-Date)       if ("False")
</code></pre>

<p>That last one surprises people sometimes; but it's strong logic, "False" is a valid string and no valid string will ever equal Boolean False ($false).</p>

<p>In the 8 Length demo, the test being evaluated is "does (Get-History) return $False?"</p>

<p><code>if ( h ) { h }</code> <em>will return $false if you run it in a brand new session</em>, run it a second time and it will return $true because now a history item exists. Being able to evaluate using cmdlets and functions can be very powerful, as long as you understand if and when a $false can be returned.</p>

<h2>Length 9</h2>

<pre><code>-computer
</code></pre>

<p>This parameter exists for cmdlets that support "implicit remoting" (such as get-process, stop-process, get-service, get-eventlog ). Generally speaking if you could do it through the management GUI or some form of WMI request you can now automate it through Powershell Cmdlets.</p>

<h2>Length 10</h2>

<pre><code>get-acl c:
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a file sharing structure then 1 of 2 things is true; either you need to "clean up the permissions one of these days" OR you've automated your standards.</p>

<p>In both cases <code>get-acl</code> and <code>set-acl</code> are better than the tools you've had before. </p>

<p>This is another tool that leverages powershell providers so it's just as easy to work with the ACL of <code>HKLM:\Sofware\ExampleSoft</code> as it is with <code>C:\Program Files\ExampleSoft</code>. Build a few scripts around the custom installs in your environment and you'll never grant "Local Admin" to a user again.</p>

<h2>Length 12 - modular function component 1</h2>

<pre><code>function f{}
</code></pre>

<p>Creates a function named f. Code within the curly brackets will be run whenever f is called. </p>

<p>In case you're wondering, since this is an empty function evaluations of f will find it equals $false.</p>

<h2>Length 13 - modular function component 2   (updated)</h2>

<p>{my original length 13 was actually 12, so I'm re-working this entry}</p>

<pre><code>$MyInvocation
</code></pre>

<p>This automatic variable exists for functions and other script blocks. It contains valuable diagnostic information about how a script block was invoked, including arguments and pipeline status.</p>

<p>If we simply place $myinvocation into our function, calls to f will return the invocation properties. </p>

<h2>Length 14 - modular function exploration1</h2>

<pre><code>$a=1..5+8
f @a
</code></pre>

<p>Running this will return the invocation properties from our function, which you can use to verify the breakdown I'm providing here.</p>

<p>This demonstrates populating a variable, and then calling our function with that variable as an argument. Since the ';' represents a break in the pipeline this can also be written as <code>$a=1..5+8;f @a</code> </p>

<p><code>$a =</code> creates (or overwrites) the variable a</p>

<p><code>1..5</code> populates $a with the numbers starting at 1 and ending at 5 (meaning that $a has actually become an array of integers).</p>

<p><code>+8</code> looks like math, but since we're working with an array of integers this is really adding the integer 8 to the existing array</p>

<p><code>f</code> since we defined 'f' as a function earlier we can now call it anywhere within the session just by using its name. Best Practice is to name functions following the Verb-Noun convention. Since function names are automagicly candidates for tab-completion do yourself a favor and only use short function names for silly things like code-golf.</p>

<p><code>@a</code> Here the space separates the function name from it's arguments. </p>

<p>The @ (array identifier) is interesting. If we call <code>f $a</code> then we pass the array as a single argument.
By specifying <code>f @a</code> we pass each individual array element as an argument. The function will behave as if called like this <code>f 1 2 3 4 5 8</code></p>

<h2>Length 15 - modular function component 3</h2>

<pre><code>$args| %{$_+$_}
</code></pre>

<p>If you ran the "Length 14" exploration code you'll see the "UnboundArguments" invocation property, the <code>$args</code> automatic variable contains an array of arguments passed to a function as undeclared parameters.</p>

<p><code>%</code> is an alias of <code>Foreach-Object</code>, which accepts the piped object and individually submits each element to the following script block  <code>{  }</code></p>

<p><code>$_</code> contains the current object in the pipeline context. </p>

<p><code>$_ + $_</code> since we are in a foreach context our current object is each individual integer in our array, we demonstrate that by adding each Integer to itself. Since the + operator is context aware it reacts appropriately to either integer or array contexts.</p>

<h2>Current Module:</h2>

<pre><code>Function f{
$myinvocation
$args| %{$_+$_}
}

<p><strong><em>Factoid:</em></strong> Rebol stands for "Relative Expression Based Object Language". It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">homoiconic</a> language (that is, code and data are expressed the same way).</p>

<p>Evaluates to an empty <a href="http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-16.html#section-2.2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">block</a> (type <code>block!</code>) which groups together values and functions and is a container for data until it is evaluated, in which case it is treated as code. Elements of blocks, even nested blocks, <a href="http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-7.html#section-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">can be accessed via a path</a>.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<pre><code>pwd

<p>Evaluates to a value of type <code>file!</code> that is the current working directory, just like in the shell! Rebol provides some familiar shell commands, like <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code> <code>pwd</code> and <code>rm</code> as mezzanine functions which behave like they would in the shell, so you can navigate around, and work with the file-system and forget that you are actually in the Rebol interpreter!</p>

But there's more: You can slice them, dice them, add and subtract them, get at their values with <code>/x</code> and <code>/y</code> (<code>/</code> being the refinement modifier that allows you to access things like values in objects or entries in arrays using a very natural, path-like syntax).</p>

<p>I've finally finished at least a very early version of an interpreter for my golfing language KSFTgolf. It probably doesn't work very well, but I'm hoping to make it better by adding instructions that would help to solve problems here. I'll probably be updating it several times while this is posted. I'll try not to break the examples I've already posted. The interpreter is here:</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with nested loops in the current version of the interpreter. I'll try to fix it, but for now, some of these might not work.</p>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<pre><code>r2eu
</code></pre>

<p>This takes a list of numbers as input and prints the sum of the squares of those numbers. Single-digit numerical literals like <code>2</code> push their value, <code>e</code> is the exponentiation function, and <code>u</code> pops a list and pushes the sum of its elements.</p>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<pre><code>trm
</code></pre>

<p>This prints all of the primes up to 1000. <code>t</code> pushes <code>1000</code>, and <code>r</code> is like a for loop.</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>on
</code></pre>

<p>This takes a character as input* and prints the ASCII value of it in binary. <code>o</code> calls Python's <code>ord()</code> function on the top element of the stack, and <code>n</code> converts the top element of the stack to binary.</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>m
</code></pre>

<p>This takes a number as input and prints <code>1</code> if the number is prime and <code>0</code> otherwise. Input is pushed onto the stack at the beginning of the program and the entire stack is printed at the end.</p>

<p>*It uses Python 2's <code>input()</code> function, so string inputs have to be in quotes.</p>

<div id="pu216" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform 7</a></h1>

<p>Inform 7 is a natural language based programming language for Interactive Fiction.</p>

<h3>Factoid</h3>

<p>Inform 7 is among the easiest languages to read, and was surreptitiously featured in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/136875051/why-s-complete-printer-spool-as-one-book#page=53">why the lucky stiff's printer spool book</a>. His code and the game it compiles to <a href="http://playfic.com/games/waxpancake/sacred-clowns-by-why-the-lucky-stiff">can be played online</a>.</p>

<h3>Length 3</h3>

<pre><code>X:Y
</code></pre>

<p>Inform 7 is a rules based language. The standard library defines many rulebooks and the player can define more. These rules are used for event handling and to create extensible procedures. Each rulebook can contain several rules, which consist of a rule <em>preamble</em>, and a body. The rule preamble is at a minimum the name of the rulebook, but it can also have many additional conditions.</p>

<p>In this example the rulebook preamble is the name of the rulebook <code>X</code>, and the body consists of a single phrase (function) <code>Y</code>. Inform 7 code is usually much more verbose than this, so these short examples will not be able to showcase the natural language aspects of the language ;).</p>

<h3>Length 4</h3>

<pre><code>X YY
</code></pre>

<p>Each rulebook has a name and a <em>basis</em>: a variable type which is the main parameter for the rulebook. When you call a rulebook you can optionally call it for a particular value, which must match the type of the basis.</p>

<p>When a rulebook is called it goes through the rules in order and runs whichever rules have matching preambles. The preambles can specify that they want to run only for a particular subclass of the basis, only for values which meet a specific condition, or only for a single specific value. Rulebooks normally run all the rules with a matching preamble, but rules can stop it from continuing. The rules of a rulebook are automatically sorted in order from most to least specific so that if only one rule will be run, it will be the most specific one (though rules can be manually repositioned).</p>

<p>This example specifies a rule preamble for the rulebook <code>X</code>. <code>YY</code> could be either a subclass of the basis, an adjective phrase which checks whether the value matches some condition, or a particular object called <code>YY</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 5</h3>

<pre><code>"[s]"
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the first example of real code! Text in Inform 7 can either be a simple literal string, or a dynamic text with substitutions which are processed at run time. Under the hood these texts are compiled to functions, but they are entirely interchangeable with simple literals.</p>

<p>Text substitutions can run essentially any other phrases/functions, and can be passed arguments too. Many come predefined in the base library. This example, the <code>to say s</code> phrase, will print an 's' if the last number printed was not 1. Similar substitutions can be used for entire sentences to output the correct grammatical inflections for a particular narration style (such as first person past tense or third person future tense), even allowing the narration style to be changed at run time.</p>
</div>
<div id="pu217" class="pu"><h1>Kotlin</h1>



<p>Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia.</p>

<p>Factoid: The name comes from the Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 <code>?</code></strong></p>

<p>Kotlin has built-in null safety. A normally declared variable cannot contain a null value, unless that type is declared with the modifier <code>?</code>. For example, <code>var a: String = "sam"; a = null</code> is an error at runtime. However, <code>var a : String? = "sam"; a = null</code> is legal.</p>

<p>This extends to parameters, where a possibly-null variable cannot be used where a not-null variabled has been specified.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 <code>?.</code></strong></p>

<p>Kotlin allows us to chain methods together, with a short cut for nulls. So, if we did <code>val myBoss = employee?.department?.boss?.name</code> then, if any of the intermediate calls were null, the final result would be null and not a null pointer exception.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 <code>out</code></strong></p>

<p>Kotlin supports declaration site variance like Scala, but using the <code>out</code> keyword rather than +. In scala, <code>trait Foo[+T]</code> makes Foo covariant in T, in Kotlin the equivilent would be <code>trait Foo[out T]</code>, similar to how C# does it. The idea being that a covariant type only produces values of T (outputs them), so the naming convention makes it easier to remember which way around co-variance and contra-variance work.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 <code>data</code></strong></p>

<p>The <code>data</code> keyword is used to create a data class. Eg, <code>data class Foo(val a: String, val b: Int)</code>. The compiler automatically generates the following functions from all properties declared in the primary constructor with a val or var: <code>equals()</code> / <code>hashCode()</code> pair, <code>toString()</code> of the form "Foo(a="qwerty", b=42)", <code>componentN()</code> functions corresponding to the properties in their order or declaration, and a <code>copy()</code> function.</p>

<p>If any of these functions are manually defined in the class body or inherited from non trivial parent types, they will not be generated.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 <code>c.foo</code></strong></p>

<p>Extension methods are methods that can be added to an already existing type. To declare an extension function, we need to prefix the name of the method with the type we wish to extend. Eg, the following adds a method to String called take:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>fun String.take(k : Int) {
 ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note, <code>this</code> inside the function refers to the receiver object. Eg, when invoking <code>string.take(4)</code> the <code>this</code> would refer to the string instance.</p>

<p><strong>Length 6: <code>inline</code></strong></p>

<p>We can ask Kotlin compiler to inline a function, so that the overhead of wrapping a closure in an object does not occur.</p>

<p>Eg, given</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>inline fun lock&lt;T&gt;(lock: Lock, body: () -&gt; T): T {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>lock(l) {foo()}
</code></pre>

<p>Would be compiled into</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>lock.lock()
try {
  foo()
}
finally {
  lock.unlock()
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 7: <code>a !is B</code></strong></p>

<p>Kotlin does not require explicit casts, but instead will smart-cast a type once an <code>is</code> or <code>!is</code>check is performed. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>// given a x of type Object
if (x is String) {
   println(x.substring(3)) // x is automatically cast to String
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now get this; the compiler is even smart enough to understand negative casts that lead to a return. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>// given a x of type Object
if (x !is String) return
// from here, x is available as a String
println(x.substring(3))
</code></pre>

<p>That's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Also Kotlin does allow unsafe casting if needed, using the <code>as</code> keyword. It will throw an exception if the cast cannot be performed. Eg,</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>val y : String = x as String
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 8: <code>when (x)</code></strong></p>

<p>When is somewhere between simple switching and pattern matching. A <code>when</code> block will match its argument against each branch until some branch condition is satisfied. The <code>when</code> block is an expression so yields a value. The default case is declared with the <code>else</code> keyword but is not needed if the compiler can see that all cases are covered. One difference with Scala here is that the branches can invoke method calls directly (with Scala we would move that to a guard clause on the case branch).</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>val k :String = ... // some string

when (k) {
  isUppercase(k) -&gt;
  isLowercase(k) -&gt;
  else -&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>fn-&gt; end
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a function, this function only returns <code>nil</code>, to call it, you must assign it to a variable, for example: <code>x=fn-&gt;123 end</code>, then call it using <code>.()</code>, such as: <code>x.()</code> that would return <code>123</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>[a: 12]
</code></pre>

<p>This is example of creating keyword list (list of key-value pair), this statements are equal to <code>[{:a, 12}]</code>. We could access the value using square bracket and the key, for example:</p>

kl[:b] # 13
kl[:c] # nil
kl[:a] = 14        # error!
kl = [a: 14] ++ kl # [a: 14, a: 12, b: 13]
kl[:a] # 14
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;65&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example on how to create a binary, this would result a valid string <code>"A"</code>, to concat the string or binary you can use <code>&lt;&gt;</code> operator, for example: <code>"AB" &lt;&gt; &lt;&lt;67,68&gt;&gt;</code> that would end as <code>ABCD</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>{1,2}

<p>This is an example on how to create a list, to get the length, use <code>length</code> function, to append with another list, use <code>++</code> operator, to remove all first element that exists in another list we could use <code>--</code> operator. To get the first and last element use <code>hd</code> and <code>tl</code> function. To get the n-th element, use <code>Enum.at</code>, to set, use <code>List.replace_at</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] ++ [4, 5]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

<p>This is an example on how to do division, the result is <code>0.5</code>, to do integer division, use <code>div</code> function, for example <code>div(7,2)</code> or <code>div 7,2</code> would return <code>3</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>?A

<p>Question mark is one way to get the integer (or code-point) value out of a character, for this example it would return <code>65</code> as defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> encoding.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>

<div id="pu219" class="pu"><h1>Befunge-98</h1>

<p>(No love for my favorite language?)</p>

<p>Befunge is a 2D programming language operating on a toroidal space - the 'grid'. In addition to the normal operators (all of which are single ASCII characters), there are also special instructions that change the direction in which the instruction pointer moves through the grid. The language was designed to be as hard as possible to compile, to this end, it contains elements of self-modification.</p>

<p>There are two versions of Befunge: <em>Befunge-93</em>, the first version (which limits the grid size to 80x25 and, as such, is not Turing-complete); and <em>Befunge-98</em>, the <a href="http://quadium.net/funge/spec98.html">final specification</a> (which allows unlimited grid size and much other useful functionality). In this post, I will use Befunge-98 for the code snippets because I feel it is the more useful of the two; a note will be included next to those snippets which are compatible with Befunge-93.</p>

<p>I recommend using <a href="https://deewiant.iki.fi/projects/ccbi/">CCBI</a> to run longer code in Befunge-98. There are some other options for if you want to see Funge-space and the stack while the program is running: <a href="http://www.bedroomlan.org/tools/befunge-93-playground">this online Befunge-93 interpreter</a> (with 'klunky' input), and <a href="http://befungius.aurlien.net/">this online Befunge-98 interpreter</a> (with no input at all, though it runs fast).</p>

<h2>Snippets</h2>

<h3>Length 1 (Also works in Befunge-93)</h3>

<pre><code>.
</code></pre>

<p>Prints out 0, forever and ever and ever. Because Befunge's space is toroidal, the pointer wraps around when it encounters an edge. Befunge starts with an empty stack for its memory; trying to pop or do operations on an empty stack makes it 'generate' as many zeroes as needed for the operation.</p>

<h3>Length 3 (Also works in Befunge-93)</h3>

<pre><code>&amp;.@
</code></pre>

<p>(Still kind of a boring example, but less so.) This one accepts a decimal number (<code>&amp;</code>) from stdin and prints it (<code>.</code>) to stdout. Then - aha, a new feature! - it terminates at the <code>@</code>. This is a pretty boring program, but you can only do so much with three characters...</p>

<h3>Length 4 (Also works in Befunge-93)</h3>

<pre><code>1+:.
</code></pre>

<p>Another infinitely looping program. Each loop takes the top number on the stack and increments it, duplicates it (with <code>:</code>), and prints one of the duplicates, leaving the other on the stack for the next loop. (Since printing a number removes it from the stack, duplication is needed in order to keep a copy.) The result of this is a program that prints the positive integers, starting from 1.</p>

<h3>Length 6 (Also works in Befunge-93)</h3>

<pre><code>8:*00p
</code></pre>

<p>Unless the user can watch Funge-space while the program is executing, this program appears to do nothing. In fact, it even <em>terminates</em>, rather than looping infinitely. "How?" you might ask. "You said before that the <code>@</code> operator ends the program, and there is no such thing here!" Here lies one of the most intriguing aspects of Befunge: the ability for the program to modify its own instruction space.</p>

<p>The <code>p</code> operator takes a number, let's call it <em>n</em>, and a coordinate pair <em>x, y</em> (in order such that <em>y</em> is on top of the stack), and puts the character with codepoint <em>n</em> in the Funge-space grid square at the given coordinates. In this case, it puts an <code>@</code> (ASCII value 64, or 8*8, or <code>8:*</code>) at position 0, 0 - the top-left corner of the program, where the <code>8</code> is initially. Then, wrapping around, the pointer hits the <code>@</code> it just set down and stops - the program has modified its own code. There is also a <code>g</code> operator that grabs the value of the character at the given coordinates; in this way, the program space can also be used as program memory that's more convenient than the stack.</p>

<p>Here's where Befunge starts to show its true colors! It's a cunning and devious language.</p>

<h3>Length 7</h3>

<pre><code>~:a`j@,
</code></pre>

<p>Here we start seeing interesting constructions, and also some features that are not in Befunge-93. This program takes exactly one line of text and prints it out again - specifically, it keeps accepting characters from stdin (using <code>~</code>) and checking whether the character is greater than 10 (<code>a</code>, new to -98), the value of a newline. If it is, it prints; if not, it terminates. This is accomplished using <code>j</code> (also new to -98), our first control operator - which pops a value and jumps over that many instructions - in this case either 1 (if the character value is greater than 10) or 0 (if it is not).</p>

<h3>Length 8</h3>

<pre><code>1#;::.+;
</code></pre>

<p>This introduces the <code>#</code> operator, or trampoline, which jumps the instruction pointer over the next symbol to execute - the same as <code>1j</code>. It originated in Befunge-93, due to <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Wire-crossing_problem">the necessity</a> of such an operator in a two-dimentional language. We can also see <code>;</code>, a 98-exclusive operator that also moves the pointer around - this one jumps it all the way to the next <code>;</code> along the direction the pointer is moving. Here it's used to create an infinite loop so the initial <code>1</code> only pushes a 1 at the beginning. The end result is a program that prints out, starting at 1, sequential powers of 2 forever and ever.</p>

Note in that languages where semi-colons are optional (JavaScript, Scala, Lua, etc.) but where lines can be split arbitrarily, there are often cases where missing semi-colons can result in ambiguous or unexpected expressions...</p>

<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>4T
</code></pre>

<p>is a valid literal number in Ceylon. It reads "four tera" and its value is <code>4_000_000_000_000</code>. Ceylon supports, like Java, digit grouping, and unlike lot of languages, number suffixes from <code>f</code> (femto, <code>e-15</code>) to <code>P</code> (peta, <code>e+15</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>

<pre><code>A|B
</code></pre>

<p>is a type which is the union of two disjoint types. This means that the value with this type can be of either <code>A</code> or <code>B</code> type. Since Ceylon does not support method overloading, it allows to define methods accepting various inputs in the same parameter, or various outputs. This feature is great to indicate a value can be null (it can't by default) and to support JavaScript dynamic types.</p>

<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>{C*}
</code></pre>

<p>Type annotation for a stream of instances of the class <code>C</code>. This stream can be evaluated lazily. That's actually a shortcut for the <code>Iterable&lt;C&gt;</code> type.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>value
</code></pre>

<p>Ceylon is strictly typed, but is able of type inference, ie. you don't have to specify the type of a local variable (or of the return value of a local function) if the compiler can infer it.<br>
You <em>have</em> to spell it out for class fields, function parameters, etc.<br>
So you can declare a local variable with the <code>value</code> keyword in place of the real type, the compiler will guess its type from its assignment. Note that the term "variable" isn't right here, as it will be immutable (the default of local declarations, you have to declare them variable explicitly to mutate them).<br>
I will continue to use the term variable here, even if they are immutable...</p>

<p><strong>Length 6</strong></p>

<pre><code>Float?
</code></pre>

<p>Type of a float variable that might be null. By default, Ceylon values cannot be null. We have to declare explicitly if null is possible in the type of the declaration itself. And then, the Ceylon compiler forces us to check if the value is null. Thus, we can never have a <code>NullPointerException</code>, which doesn't exists in the language! It is one of the rare totally null-safe languages (Rust is another one, with a very different approach).<br>
Note that this type declaration is actually a shortcut for <code>Float|Null</code>, ie. as seen above, the union of <code>Float</code> and of the <code>Null</code> type (which has only one instance: <code>null</code>).<br>
Also note that <code>Float</code> is a class on its own, with methods. It is optimized to the Java <code>float</code> primitive by the compiler, though.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7</strong></p>

<pre><code>Float[]
</code></pre>

<p>Type of a sequence of float values which can be empty. It is a shortcut for <code>Sequential&lt;Float&gt;</code> and can be written <code>[Float*]</code>, similar to the stream / iterable annotation. The difference is that a sequential can be indexed with the <code>[i]</code> notation, like an array. For the record, a <code>Sequence&lt;T&gt;</code> (or <code>[T+]</code>) is a sequential that cannot be empty. An empty sequential has the type <code>Empty</code> and is noted <code>[]</code>, of course.<br>
Note that <code>seq[i]</code> where <code>seq</code> is a <code>Float[]</code> is of type <code>Float?</code> ie. the result can be <code>null</code>, if the index is out of the bounds.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8</strong></p>

<pre><code>a else b
</code></pre>

<p>As seen above, if <code>a</code> is of type <code>A?</code> ie. can be <code>null</code>, you cannot use it without checking if it is null. It cannot be done with <code>a == null</code>, Ceylon offers various ways to check this. The code above is one of them: if <code>a</code> isn't null, use its value, otherwise, use the value of <code>b</code> (which cannot be null, of course; we can chain the checks...).</p>

<p><strong>Length 9</strong></p>

<pre><code>\{BULLET}
</code></pre>

<p>is a valid Ceylon character: you can put any Unicode name between the braces, like <code>\{CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)}</code> or <code>\{WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS}</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 10</strong></p>

<pre><code>if(is T v)
</code></pre>

<p>As we seen, we can define union types, meaning that a variable can have one of several types, eg. <code>Integer</code> or <code>Float</code> (or <code>Byte</code> or... etc.).<br>
If all the subtypes derivate from the same interface, we can use the methods of the parent interface.<br>
For example, if we have <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; | LinkedList&lt;String&gt; dualList</code>, we can use <code>dualList.size</code> directly.<br>
To use a method specific to one of the member of the union, you have to be sure it is of the given type.
For this, Ceylon offers a mechanism allowing in the same shot to check the type, and to downcast it to the specific type: <code>if (is ArrayList dualList) { Integer capacity = dualList.capacity; }</code> is legal because at this point, the compiler is sure to have an <code>ArrayList</code>.<br>
It is equivalent to Java's <code>instanceof</code> and cast in the same shot, just safer: in Java, you can cast to something else than the type you checked!<br>
Note that <code>is</code> is also an operator (resulting in a <code>Boolean</code>) that doesn't narrow down the type. <code>Boolean b = v is T;</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 11</strong></p>

<pre><code>"N ``p.n``"
</code></pre>

<p>Ceylon has string interpolation: you can embed in a literal string an expression between a pair of double backticks. The value of the expression will replace this placeholder. You can have simple local values, field access as shown, complex expressions or function calls. You can have literal strings (with interpolation too!) inside these expressions.</p>

<p><strong>Length 12</strong></p>

<pre><code>f=(A p)=&gt;-p;
</code></pre>

<p>Assigns to the <code>f</code> variable an anonymous function defined with the short syntax (fat arrow).
Functions are first-class citizens in Ceylon, they are just objects that can be assigned, passed as parameter, returned from another function, etc.<br>
To fit in the length, I omitted the declaration of <code>f</code> which can be done earlier, for example: <code>A(A) f;</code><br>
Here, <code>f</code> returns the negation of the <code>p</code> parameter which has the type <code>A</code>.<br>
Notice the usage of the negation operator <code>-</code> which must have been overloaded in the definition of <code>A</code>, which then must satisfy the interface <code>Invertible&lt;A&gt;</code>.<br>
Ceylon doesn't support to define arbitrary operators (unlike Scala, where users can get crazy with this feature... :-)), nor even "true" operator overloading, but it supports operator polymorphism: operators are defined (by name, eg. <code>negated</code> for the unary minus) in specific interfaces (here <code>Invertible</code>) that classes needing these operators must implement (must satisfy, in Ceylon vocabulary).</p>

<p><strong>Length 13</strong></p>

<pre><code>C&lt;out T&gt;(T t)
</code></pre>

<p>Declaration-site variance: the class <code>C</code> (the <code>class</code> keyword and the class body have been omitted for brevity) declares, in its definition, its type parameter <code>T</code> to be <em>covariant</em>, so <code>C&lt;Car&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>C&lt;Vehicle&gt;</code> if <code>Car</code> is a subtype of <code>Vehicle</code>.<br>
Collection interfaces (immutable by default), like <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> are declared covariants.<br>
Mutable collections must satisfy an additional interface with a <em>contravariant</em> declaration (<code>&lt;out T&gt;</code>), defining methods accepting the given class or any supertype of it: a mutable list of <code>Vehicle</code> must accept adding <code>Car</code>s.<br>
Java is using use-site variance, like <code>List&lt;? extends Car&gt;</code>, defined on each <code>List</code> declaration. It is a bit more flexible but puts the burden on the users of the class, so is more cumbersome.<br>
Since version 1.1, Ceylon also support use-site variance for Java interoperability reasons, but promotes declaration-site variance as the preferred method.<br>
Also note the parameter list of the class: it defines both the parameters of the constructor of the class, and the corresponding fields, in the same shot! No need for these cumbersome <code>this.t = t;</code>...</p>

<p><strong>Length 14</strong></p>

<pre><code>for(n in 0..5)
</code></pre>

<p>Ceylon doesn't have the classical C-like numerical <code>for</code> loop. Instead, it supports range definitions, and allows to iterate on them.<br>
Here, <code>n</code> (whose type, <code>Integer</code>, is inferred) will go from 0 to 5, included. We could have written <code>0:6</code> instead (start, number of items). A range like <code>5..0</code> allows count-downs.<br>
These notations are just syntax sugar for declaring instances of the <code>Range&lt;T&gt;</code> class. We can have ranges of numbers, characters or any other type <code>T</code> satisfying the <code>Enumerable</code> interface.</p>

<p><strong>Length 15</strong></p>

<pre><code>return["",0.0];
</code></pre>

<p>Return statement in a function. Here, the type of the return value is <code>[ String, Float ]</code>. That's a tuple, of type <code>Tuple</code>.<br>
A tuple is linked list (therefore a <code>Sequence</code>) which captures the static type of each individual element in the list.<br>
We can then access safely each element by its index: <code>Float v = tuple[1];</code>; the compiler knows the size of the tuple and the type of each entry.<br>
Tuples are a practical / compact mean to return several values from a function, where in Java we must create a <em>Pojo</em> (simple, often internal, class with just fields) for this.<br>
Side note: Ceylon doesn't accept abbreviated, unreadable (IMHO) shortcuts for floats: neither <code>0.</code> nor <code>.0</code> are accepted, we must write <code>0.0</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 16</strong></p>

<pre><code>shared T v=T(1);
</code></pre>

<p>A variable or attribute of a class (field in Java vocabulary) declaration. The variable is immutable (the default) and has a visibility annotation. Unlike Java fields, attributes (and variables) don't have an implicit default value  so they must be assigned at the declaration site (or must be, for attributes, in the parameter list of the class).<br>
Note that <code>T(1)</code> creates a new instance of T with one parameter. Unlike Java, we don't need the <code>new</code> keyword.<br>
<code>shared</code> is an annotation, not a keyword. Declarations are private by default, visible only in the code unit where they are declared: the class they belong to, or the package of the file where they are declared, if they are top-level.<br>
<code>shared</code> extends the visibility to the parent: a shared declaration in a class is visible in the class enclosing this class, if any, or otherwise in the whole package containing the class. If a top-level declaration is shared, it is visible to everything that can see the containing package. If the package is shared, it is visible (and its shared declarations) by other packages in the same module, and by code in other modules which import that module.
Works like Russian puppets...<br>
We introduced two concepts: packages are like in Java, folders in a folder hierarchy where the path defines a namespace / visibility unit. They allow to organize code in logical groups. Unlike Java, we <em>must</em> declare packages in a special file named <code>package.ceylon</code> in the package they belong to. That's where we declare if a package is shared (or not, by default). On the other hand, we don't have to declare the package on each file of the folder...<br>
Modules are groups of packages, also declared in their own file (<code>module.ceylon</code>) at the root of the package hierarchy.
They <em>must</em> declare a version number, and <em>must</em> import the modules (with their version number) used in code belonging to this module. This allows modularity of the code with fine grained management of the required versions.</p>

<p><strong>Length 17</strong></p>

<pre><code>assert(exists x);
</code></pre>

<p>Like in Java, <code>assert</code> throws an exception if its expression is false. But unlike Java, the compiler knows that after the <code>assert</code> statement, the condition is true. Here, the expression checks if <code>x</code>, of type <code>T?</code> (remember: that's <code>T | Null</code> ie. either <code>T</code> or <code>Null</code>), exists, ie. is not <code>null</code>. So the compiler accepts to use <code>x.foo</code> after the <code>assert</code> in the same block, because it known it isn't null.<br>
<code>exists</code> can be used in a <code>if</code> too, if that's unsure. <code>assert</code> is used if the programmer knows for sure (except programming error!) that a variable initially null has been set to a non-null value at this point in the code. So <code>assert</code> is used here as a helper of the type checker of the compiler which hasn't flow analysis...</p>

<p><strong>Length 18</strong></p>

<pre><code>class C(Float f){}
</code></pre>

<p>Declares a class and its constructor and its attributes in the same shot: the class' parameters are those of the constructor of the class, which then doesn't need to be defined explicitly. These parameters become attributes (equivalent to Java's fields), so no need for <code>this.f = f</code>, the syntax is streamlined, without boilerplate.<br>
Note that a class can have only one constructor, because Ceylon doesn't support method overloading. Instead, it has parameters with default values (and therefore optional parameters), named parameters, etc.<br>
It also implies that the class has an <em>initializer</em> section, containing a mix of declarations, statements and control structures. The initializer is executed every time the class is instantiated and initializes the state of the new instance of the class.</p>

Rank is a central concept in J, and allows to automatically extend verbs towards arrays of higher dimensions. Both nouns and verbs have a rank.</p>
<p><em>Noun rank</em> is the number of dimensions of any noun, which the verb <code>$@$</code> can tell you. For example <code>i. 2 3 4</code> is an array of rank 3.</p>

<p>From time to time, you end up in situations where due to selections made in data,
there are singleton dimensions running in the way.
This handy utility, called squeeze in Matlab, squeezes out all singleton dimensions.

<p><code>@CompileStatic()</code></p>

<p>Another AST. Since it's a dynamic a language, Groovy may run slightly slower than Java. This isn't usually a problem, specially when working with databases and network, but bottlenecks may happen. Enter <code>@CompileStatic</code>. This AST walks the tree representation and makes every call a more pure bytecode call, giving <a href="http://objectscape.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/groovy-20-performance-compared-to-java.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java-like performance</a> to your Groovy code. Here only Extensions and AST metaprogramming work. You can add it to a class and have it fully statically compiled, and have a single method of this class being dynamic using <code>@CompileStatic(SKIP)</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 14 snippet</h3>

<p><code>{}.setDelegate</code></p>

<p>Every statement written inside a closure bears an interesting property: you can change the object which will respond to them. Also you can set the resolving order of responding objects. The topic is lengthy and i won't go over details, but this is possible:</p>

<pre><code>c = {
    gimme "wot!"
}

c.delegate = new Expando(gimme: { it }) // this guy will answer the 'gimme' call
c.resolveStrategy = Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST

assert c() == "wot!"
</code></pre>

<h3>Length 13 snippet</h3>

<p><code>s ==~ /^echo/</code></p>

<p>This snippet shows the (unofficially named) dynamite operator and a variant on string declarations. Groovy has a lot of ways to declare strings; <code>'simple-quoted strings'</code>, <code>"double-quoted-with-interpolation-string"</code>, <code>"""multi-line string"""</code> and what not. But those two stand over the crowd when it comes to regex: <code>/slashy string/</code> and <code>$/dollar-slashy-string/$</code>. No need to escape stuff, yey: <code>/\d+/</code>!</p>

<h3>Length 12 snippet</h3>

<p><code>@TypeChecked</code></p>

<p>This is an AST Transformation. It walks on the class/method where it is annotated and checks for typing errors. Groovy was born as a pure dynamic language, although you could add types to method params and return. Later on, a lot of people coming from a Java background felt the terseness of Groovy was great, but the dynamic typing was not so, thus <code>@TypeChecked</code> was born. It will still allow Groovy's neat syntax, extensions and other compile-time metaprogramming to occur, but it will report errors on stuff unknown at compile-time.</p>

<h3>Length 11 snippet</h3>

<p><code>10.0 * 12.0</code></p>

<p>Oh, a mere float multiplication, you say? O noes. A digit-dot-digit in Groovy defaults to a BigDecimal, for arbitrary precision calculation. A must for financial calculations. Since operators are only allowed in Java using primitives (and something in String), using a lot of BigDecimals in Java can get messy; this snippet can be written in Java as <code>new BigDecimal("10").multiply(new BigDecimal("20"))</code>. For floats, add an <code>f</code>: <code>10.0f</code>, a <code>d</code> for double, a <code>g</code> for BigInteger, and a lot more.</p>

<h3>Length 10 snippet</h3>

<p><code>.metaClass</code></p>

<p>Every object in Groovy has this little property which is responsible for keeping up the MOP (Meta Object Protocol), which allows Groovy's metaprogramming: we can add methods, properties and even mix entires classes one into another to add functionality. It really shines when you are working on pure dynamic Groovy, but it is not limited to.</p>

<h3>Length 9 snippet</h3>

<p><code>a?.b?.c.d</code></p>

<p>The safe navigation operator. It stop navigating on objects which might be null. This won't throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> if <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> are null, but <code>c</code> must not be null.</p>

<h3>Length 8 snippet</h3>

<p><code>"a".tr()</code></p>

<p>The <code>a</code> object is a <code>java.lang.String</code>, but <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String.html#tr%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tr</code></a> is not a method on Java's String. So what is going on here? Groovy features an Extension Mechanism. When the runtime finds an extension declaration in the classpath, it is automagically added to classes to enhance them. Extensions are statically compilable.</p>

<h3>Length 7 snippet</h3>

<p><code>[:]+[:]</code></p>

<p>Although the term is on pretty gray area, Groovy is a strongly typed language; the runtime makes little or no conversions between types. This snippet is really calling a well-defined method, which you can override, if needed. It can be understood pretty much as <code>new HashMap().plus(new HashMap())</code></p>

<h3>Length 6 snippet</h3>

<p><code>a b {}</code></p>

<p>This snippet is parsed differently from snippet 5; from right to left. A method <code>a</code> receives the result of a method <code>b</code> receiving a closure/lambda as a param. Curly brackets <code>{}</code> is a closure/lambda/function, in Groovy. </p>

<h3>Length 5 snippet</h3>

<p><code>u w m</code></p>

<p>We can omit a lot of punctuation, as long as we remember Groovy's parsing order. This snippet is understood as <code>u(w).getM()</code>.</p>

<h3>Length 4 snippet</h3>

<p><code>a*.b</code></p>

<p>The <em>spread dot</em> allows calling a method, or getting a property, from any iterable. This snippet is collecting the property <code>b</code> from every object in the list <code>a</code> (assuming it is a list).</p>

<h3>Length 3 snippet</h3>

<p><code>&lt;=&gt;</code></p>

<p>The spaceship operator! Calling this is akin to calling the <code>compareTo</code> method.

<h3>Length 2 snippet</h3>

<p><code>?:</code></p>

<p>The Elvis operator (tilt your head sideways to see it ;-) ). Every class has an <code>asBoolean()</code> method. Elvis calls it (in a deep mississipi voice) and, when true, returns the value, otherwise, the <code>else</code> part. Checking an empty list? Easy: <code>list ?: [1, 2, 3]</code></p>

<h3>Length 1 snippet</h3>

<p><code>&amp;</code></p>

<p>An <code>and</code> operator. Groovy supports operator overload, but in a slightly safer way: they are overloaded through their names and only a subset of them is available. You can overload the <code>&amp;</code> operator by implementing a method called <code>and(param)</code> in your class.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>"AB"_m*
</code></pre>

<p><code>m*</code> creates all the Cartesian products of the top two stack elements. For instance, the above code will put <code>["AA" "AB" "BA" "BB"]</code> on stack, which is the cartesian product of <code>"AB"</code> and <code>"AB"</code>.</p>

<p>A nice looking repeated code. DO NOT run this :) . This representation of code is the basis for the simplest quine in CJam. You put string <code>"_~"</code> on stack, make a copy (<code>_</code>) and evaluate it. Which in turns does the same thing again (and again ..) until you reach maximum recursion exception.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{A}:F

<p>This gives the current timestamp (milliseconds from the epoch). CJam also has <code>et</code> for local time in a more usable format which returns an array comprising of the various parts of the current time ( day, hour etc).</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>A

<p>CJam has almost all capital alphabets as predefined variables. <code>A</code> is 10, <code>B</code> is 11 and till <code>K</code> is 20. <code>P</code> is <code>pi (3.141592653589793)</code>, <code>N</code> is new line and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/cjam/wiki/Variables/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">many others</a>. These can come very handy when you need initial values in variables, or even when you need two digit number in 1 byte.</p>

<p>Like Befunge, >&lt;> is a stack-based 2D language. This means that instructions aren't executed linearly like most traditional languages — program flow can be up, down, left or right!</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>X
</code></pre>

<p><code>X</code> is an invalid command in >&lt;>, so the error message <code>something smells fishy...</code> is printed. In fact, this is the only error message in >&lt;>, whether the cause be division by zero or trying to pop an empty stack.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>1n
</code></pre>

<p>Program flow in >&lt;> starts from the top left and is initially rightward. <code>1</code> pushes a 1 onto the stack, then <code>n</code> prints it as a number (as opposed to as an ASCII char). But >&lt;> programs are toroidal, meaning that the instruction pointer wraps around when it reaches the end of a line. So after the <code>n</code> we wrap to beginning, push a 1, print, wrap to the beginning, push a 1, print ... and we end up printing <code>1</code>s forever! </p>

<p><strong>Length 3 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>"o;
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>"</code> is string parsing, <code>o</code> outputs as an ASCII char and <code>;</code> terminates the program. But what does the program actually do as a whole?</p>

<p>Well first we start string parsing, pushing every char we see onto the stack until we find a closing <code>"</code>. We push an <code>o</code>, then a <code>;</code> ... and wrap the instruction pointer back to the start. But now we're on a <code>"</code> so we <em>stop</em> string parsing, and finally we execute the <code>o</code> and <code>;</code> as normal to print the top of the stack (the <code>;</code>) and terminate.</p>

<p>Yes, we've just used the same quote char to start and end a string!</p>

<p><strong>Length 4 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>42n;
</code></pre>

<p>Based on what we've seen so far, you might expect this to push 42, output as a number then terminate. But all instructions in >&lt;> are single chars, so this actually pushes <strong>a 4 and a 2</strong>, then outputs the top of the stack as a number (only the 2) and terminates.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;v
;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, >&lt;> is a 2D language. This means that there's got to be ways to change the direction of program flow!</p>

<p>Like Befunge, one way you can do this is via the arrows <code>&gt;^v&lt;</code>. To illustrate how they work, let's look at the above program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Program flow is initially rightward</li>
<li><code>&lt;</code> makes program flow leftward — we go off the left and wrap around to the <code>v</code></li>
<li><code>v</code> makes program flow downward — we go down to the <code>&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&gt;</code> makes program flow rightward — we go off the right and wrap around to the <code>;</code></li>
<li>Finally, we terminate.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Length 6 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>";"00p
</code></pre>

<p>Another cool feature of >&lt;> is that it's reflexive — the program can modify its own source code on the fly!</p>

<p>Here we push a <code>;</code>, followed by two zeroes. <code>p</code> then pops the top three elements <code>y</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>v</code> (<code>y</code> being the top of the stack) and places <code>v</code> at the position <code>x,y</code>. In other words, the <code>p</code> in this program puts a semicolon at the position <code>0,0</code>, turning the code into <code>;;"00p</code>. This then allows the program to terminate, as the instruction pointer now wraps around and executes the newly-placed <code>;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>\7*n;
6
</code></pre>

<p><em>Un</em>like Befunge, >&lt;> also has mirrors (<code>\/|_#</code>) which reflect the direction of program flow. So here we:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start rightward, but the <code>\</code> reflects us downward</li>
<li>Push a 6 and wrap</li>
<li>Hit the backside of the <code>\</code> and reflect back to rightward</li>
<li>Push a 7</li>
<li>Multiply the top two of the stack</li>
<li>Output and terminate</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving horizontally through a <code>_</code> mirror or vertically through a <code>|</code> mirror is a no-op.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>"r00g&gt;o&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>Quite possibly the simplest >&lt;> quine if an error is allowed to be thrown. The two new instructions here are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>r</code>: Reverse the stack</li>
<li><code>g</code>: Get — pop <code>y</code>,<code>x</code> and push the character at <code>x,y</code> onto the stack (counterpart to <code>p</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the string wrapping trick from before, the program initially pushes <code>r00g&gt;o&lt;</code> then hits the first quote again. The stack is then reversed, giving <code>&lt;o&gt;g00r</code>. After that we push the char at <code>0,0</code>, the <code>"</code>, to give <code>&lt;o&gt;g00r"</code>. Finally, we trap an <code>o</code> between two arrows, outputting the top of the stack until there's nothing left and we get an error.</p>

<p><strong>Length 9 snippet:</strong></p>

<pre><code>x0\&gt;
\1n&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>x</code> (lower case) moves the instruction pointer in a random direction, and the program showcases this functionality by printing random bits forever. Try following the arrows and mirrors to figure out how this works! (Don't forget to check all four directions, including up and left)</p>

<pre><code>1!X2!X+!Xn;

<p><code>!</code> is a trampoline which skips over instructions. It's particularly useful when used with <code>?</code>, a <em>conditional</em> trampoline which pops the top of the stack and executes the next instruction if the popped element is nonzero. We'll see how this works later.</p>

<p>The above code prints 3 by skipping over the <code>X</code>s, only executing <code>1! 2! +! n;</code>.</p>

<li><code>a</code>: Push 10, which we need for newline. <code>a-f</code> push 10 to 15 respectively.</li>
<li><code>:</code>: Duplicate top of stack</li>
<li><code>@</code>: Rotate the top three elements of the stack, e.g. <code>[5 4 3 2 1] -&gt; [5 4 1 3 2]</code>.</li>

</code></pre>

<p>A "tac" program which reads in a line of input and outputs it reversed. Thanks to @tomsmeding for the snippet.</p>

<p><code>=</code> pops the top two elements and pushes 1 if they're equal, 0 otherwise. The first line keeps reading in input until ASCII char 13 (carriage return) is found, at which point it moves to the second line.</p>

<p>The <code>l?!;o</code> loop is an important construct in >&lt;> which outputs the entire stack. Unlike <code>&gt;o&lt;</code>, it doesn't cause any errors. This is how it works:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>l</code> pushes the length of the stack</li>
<li>We check the length with <code>?</code>:

<ul>
<li>If the length was nonzero, then the next instruction <code>!</code> is executed, skipping the <code>;</code></li>
<li>If the length <em>was</em> zero, then we don't execute <code>!</code> and terminate due to the <code>;</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that no output actually happens until you hit carriage return.</p>

<p>In addition to changing the direction of program flow, you can actually move the instruction pointer anywhere you like!</p>

<p><code>.</code> pops <code>y</code>,<code>x</code> and teleports the instruction pointer to <code>x,y</code>, maintaining direction. Note, however, that you need to move to one square before where you want to go — the instruction pointer is updated before the next instruction is executed. So here the instruction pointer lands on the invalid <code>X</code>, but all is okay since the pointer moves to the <code>6</code> before continuing execution.</p>

<p><code>.</code> makes it possible to convert most >&lt;> programs into a one-liner, but why would you want to lose the fun of 2D? :)</p>

<p>If you wondered about how to modify the previous quine (snippet #8) so that it wouldn't cause an error and thought "why don't I just add a ton of <code>o</code> instructions?", then you might realise that for every <code>o</code> you add, you need to output another <code>o</code>! This quine neatly solves the problem by putting a <code>|</code> mirror at the end, which allows each <code>o</code> to be used <strong>twice</strong>.</p>

<p>If we switch to single quotes (which are also for string parsing), then an alternative quine which doesn't use <code>g</code> is</p>

<p>We have addition (<code>+</code>), subtraction (<code>-</code>), multiplication (<code>*</code>), modulo (<code>%</code>)... but what about division? It's there, but since <code>/</code> is already a mirror, division has been assigned the <code>,</code> symbol instead. Interestingly, division is <em>float</em> division, not integer division!</p>

<p>The above program explores some undefined behaviour by trying to jump to <code>11/2, 6/3</code>. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6392418" rel="noreferrer">Python intepreter</a> seems okay if the first coordinate is not an integer (although it jumps to the wrong spot), but chokes if the second isn't.</p>

<p>We've seen <code>r</code> which reverses the stack and <code>@</code> which rotates the top three elements. Here are a few more commands which move elements on the stack:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$</code>: Swap the top two elements</li>
<li><code>{</code>: Shift the whole stack left</li>
<li><code>}</code>: Shift the whole stack right</li>
</ul>

<p>Up until now I've been saying "the stack", "the stack"...</p>

<p>Although most programs use only one stack, >&lt;> can actually have multiple stacks! Here are the relevant instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[</code>: Pops <code>x</code> and moves the top <code>x</code> elements to a new stack</li>
<li><code>]</code>: Removes the current stack, and moves its values to the underlying stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the trace for the above program:</p>

<pre><code>       [r e w a r d]       Push "reward"
4[     [r e] [w a r d]     Move four elements to a new stack
r      [r e] [d r a w]     Reverse the current stack
oooo   [r e] []            Output "ward"
]      [r e]               Remove the current stack, no values to move
oo     []                  Output "er", giving "warder" altogether
</code></pre>

<p>Note that simply pushing <code>reward</code> and then outputting it again with <code>oooooo</code> would print <code>drawer</code>, due to the "first in, last out" nature of stacks.</p>

Calling <code>&amp;</code> for the first time moves the top value of the stack to the register, and executing <code>&amp;</code> again moves the value back. This can be very useful when accumulating a value, for example sums and factorials.</p>

<p>Unfortunately >&lt;> only allows reading from STDIN one char at a time, which makes reading in numbers a little tricky. For input consisting of digits 0-9, this program is essentially atoi, converting a string of digits from STDIN into a number on the stack (which is then printed).</p>

<p>Another note is that on EOF, <code>i</code> pushes -1 onto the stack. This makes checking for EOF easy by comparing to 0 using <code>(</code>, or "less than".</p>

<p>The program reads in a single ASCII character and runs the <code>3x+1</code> algorithm on its code point (In >&lt;>, characters are basically integers). Each step of the algorithm is printed until we hit 1.</p>

<p>I don't feel like I've done the <code>p</code> command justice, having only used it once all the way back in snippet #6, so here's a different atoi function. What's cool about this one? The program <em>writes the expression needed to calculate the number</em> as it reads the input!</p>

<p>So for input like <code>573</code>, after all chars are read the end of the third line will look like <code>\0a*5+a*7+a*3+</code>, which evaluates to 573!</p>

<p>If you've managed to get down to here, then you might agree with me when I say that this is one very readable ROT13 program.

<p>Try it in the console, and watch the letters transform as you type!</p>

<h3>Factoid:</h3>
<p>The extremely serious ShellShock bug was present in Bash since 1989, and remained undiscovered for a quarter of a century.  Much of the joy of writing Bash is coming to grips with its many idiosyncracies and inconsistencies.</p>
<h3>Length 1 snippet:</h3>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>[
</code></pre>
<p>An alias for the <code>test</code> builtin, allowing code of the format <code>if [ a == b ]; then</code> - in reality <code>[</code> is a standalone command, not a syntactical element, and <code>]</code> is purely decorative (although required by [, its requirement is arbitrary and you can do away with it by using <code>alias [=test</code>).</p>
<h3>Length 2 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>||
</code></pre>
<p>Like logical <code>or</code> in most languages, but for processes.  Will execute the command after the <code>||</code> only if the command before it returns non-zero.</p>
<h3>Length 3 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>x=y
</code></pre>
<p>Assignment.  Nice and predictable... but unlike most other languages, extra spaces aren't allowed. Which is kind of funny because you can stick extra spaces pretty much everywhere else between things in bash, just not around the <code>=</code>.</p>
<h3>Length 4 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>$IFS
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Internal Field Separator</strong> - this variable affects how Bash splits data for many built-in actions, such as iterating in for loops and populating arrays from strings.  Used correctly it can be very powerful; but more often it's the cause of subtle and unpredictable bugs.</p>
<h3>Length 5 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>${x^}
</code></pre>
<p>Substitute the string in x, but with the first character capitalised!  Such a frequently used feature that it has its own dedicated piece of language syntax.</p>
<h3>Length 6 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>x=($y)
</code></pre>
<p>Fill an array, x, from a string or list of elements y, splitting on whatever the IFS is currently set to - by default, whitespace.  A very useful feature for advanced bash programming.</p>
<h3>Length 7 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>${x[y]}
</code></pre>
<p>Arrays!  But wait, what's that... y is a string, not a numerical index?  Yes indeed, Bash supports associative arrays!  Many people don't know this.  You just need to <code>declare -A x</code> first.</p>
<h3>Length 8 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>${x##*,}
</code></pre>
<p>Substitute x, everything up until the last <code>,</code> character (or whatever you specify).  Useful to get the last field of a csv - this is something you can't so easily do with <code>cut</code>, which only counts fields from the left.  % and %% allows the same to cut from the right; % and # were chosen for their location on the US keyboard so it would be clear which means left and which means right, but that doesn't hold much value for everyone not using a US keyboard :)</p>
<h3>Length 9 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>[ a = b ]

<p>This is what happens if you forget about the mandatory spaces.  Will not throw an error.  <strong>Will always return true</strong> - even if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are variables that are unset, or whatever they're set to, doesn't matter - it'll always return true.  Think about code like <code>if [ &quot;$password&quot;=&quot;$correctpass&quot; ]</code> to see the fun potential of this &quot;feature&quot;.</p>

<h3>Length 13 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>function x(){
</code></pre>
<p>A bit of C syntax has mysteriously crept in!  One of many completely different uses for curly braces, and another example of optional decorative elements to make Bash look more like other languages - either <code>()</code> or <code>function</code> can be omitted here (but not both).  Also more fun with inconsistent spaces - a space after the <code>{</code> is mandatory, but <strong>not</strong> before the closing <code>}</code>, as in <code>function x { y;}</code></p>
<h3>Length 14 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>echo {Z..A..3}
</code></pre>
<p>Yet another totally unrelated use of curly braces. Expands a range with a specified step.  In this case, will produce every 3rd letter from Z to A.  Useful for generating sequences without using seq, but cannot be used with variables, so has limited functionality.</p>
<h3>Length 15 snippet:</h3>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>echo {a,b,c,d}x
</code></pre>
<p>Another similar but not identical use for curly braces in sequence generation; prints <code>ax bx cx dx</code>, and is useful for generating a list of strings from a sequence or list in a single command.  Again however, limited in usefulness as it can't be used with variables inside the braces.</p>

<div id="pu226" class="pu"><h1>Agda</h1>

<h3>Factoid:</h3>

<p>Agda is a Haskell inspired language with even more advanced type system, that makes it possible to declare statements about programs and proof their validity. It comes with proof assistant tools, embedded into Emacs, so you can use it interactively to construct mathematical proofs.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<pre><code>_
</code></pre>

<p>Underscore has bunch of meanings in Agda. It can mean a wildcard, meaning you don't care about naming stuff when you pattern match. It can tell Agda to guess values or types, which it does by solving type equations. Or as a placeholder in function definitions, it can be placed nearly anywhere, so that definition of post,pre,infix operators are possible (e.g. <code>_!</code> can define factorial and <code>if_then_else_</code> a condition clause).</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<pre><code>()
</code></pre>

<p>An absurd pattern. Doing a pattern match on an absurd pattern tells Agda, that this pattern is impossible. Or in other words, we trying to match to an empty type (bottom <code>⊥</code>), the type with no values.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<pre><code>Set
</code></pre>

<p>Types and values in Agda are treated similarly. As value can be of a certain type, the type itself can be of a type of something, this something is called <code>Set</code>. For example <code>0 : ℕ : Set</code> means that zero has type of natural numbers (or just 0 is a natural number) and natural numbers are of type <code>Set</code> (or natural numbers represent type or set). But it doesn't end here, because even <code>Set</code> has type <code>Set₁</code>, which has type <code>Set₂</code> and all the way up to infinity (and beyond).</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p><code>data</code> keyword is used to define types in Haskell's GADT (Generalized Algebraic Data Types) style. Here are some examples</p>

<p>Empty type</p>

<pre><code>data ⊥ : Set where
</code></pre>

<p>Boolean type</p>

<pre><code>data Bool : Set where
  false : Bool
  true : Bool
</code></pre>

<p>Natural numbers</p>

<pre><code>data ℕ : Set where
  zero : ℕ
  suc : ℕ → ℕ
</code></pre>

<h3>5</h3>

<pre><code>f = f
</code></pre>

<p>Spaces around operators are mandatory, so we can only now construct some simple definition. This snippet is a valid definition of non-interrupting program in Haskell, but it won't compile in Agda due to the Termination check failure. Agda is a total language, meaning every program in it should terminate and there is no way to construct a valid non-terminating function. The reason behind it is that this function can be of an arbitrary type <code>f : ∀ A → A</code>, and due to Curry–Howard isomorphism between programs and proofs, constructing a value of any type basically means that we proved everything!</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<pre><code>record
</code></pre>

<p>Agda has records, datatypes with single constructor. For example we can define a pair like so</p>

<pre><code>record Π (A B : Set) : Set where
  constructor _,_
  field
    first  : A
    second : B
</code></pre>

<p>And we can define pairs now <code>p = (zero , false)</code> (parenthesis can be omitted) and extract fields from them: <code>Π.first p</code> is <code>zero</code> and <code>Π.second p</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Also there is a convention to define a type with one element as an empty record</p>

<pre><code>record ⊤ : Set where
</code></pre>

<p>There is only one value of type <code>⊤</code>, which automatically deduced to be an empty record <code>record {}</code>, it can be used to define true propositions.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<pre><code>∃ n = n
</code></pre>

<p>For an arbitrary type of <code>n</code> this is just an identity function, but if it has type for example <code>∃ : ℕ → ℕ</code> then it can be interpreted as a proof that natural numbers exist!</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<pre><code>λ n -&gt; n
</code></pre>

<p>The same identity function can be written as an anonymous function (lambda). It can be written as a 7 length snippet with <code>→</code> instead of <code>-&gt;</code>, but I can't come up with a more interesting 8-snippet otherwise.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<pre><code>λ x _ → x
</code></pre>

<p>This would be a definition of a constant function that returns its first argument and discards the second. A complete defintion with the most general type that works with argument types of any universe looks like this</p>

<pre><code>const : ∀ {α β}
       → {A : Set α} {B : Set β}
       → (A → B → A)
const = λ x _ → x
</code></pre>

<p>Stuff inside curly brackets <code>{}</code> tells Agda that this variables are implicit and they should be decided based on the explicit variables <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. It's possible to include them anyways like this <code>const {α} {β} {A} {B} x _ = x</code>.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<pre><code>Th = ⊥ → ⊤
</code></pre>

<p>Here I defined a theorem <code>Th</code> : false implies true. I can prove it by constructing a value of type <code>Th</code>. As I mentioned earlier a true proposition <code>⊤</code> has only one value and it also represents an empty record and the proof would be just returning it</p>

<pre><code>f→t : Th
f→t = λ _ → record {}
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly we can proof <code>⊤ → ⊤</code> or <code>∀ A → ⊤</code>, so basically anything implies true propositions. Contrary to false propositions, which can't be proven without constructing a value of empty type. We can proof <code>⊥ → ⊥</code> by absurd pattern and <code>⊤ → ⊥</code> can't be proven. Therefore a complete implication table in Agda is represented in following statements</p>

<pre><code>f→t : ⊥ → ⊤
f→t = λ _ → record {} -- empty record

t→t : ⊤ → ⊤
t→t = f→t -- same proof

f→f : ⊥ → ⊥
f→f () -- absurd pattern

t→f : ⊤ → ⊥
t→f = {!!} -- nothing could be written here, just a hole
</code></pre>

<h3>11</h3>

<pre><code>¬ P = P → ⊥
</code></pre>

<p>The definition of propositional negation. You can look at it this way: if <code>¬ P</code> is true then <code>P</code> is false and therefore should imply false <code>⊥</code> (<code>P</code> also should be implied from false, but everything is implied from <code>⊥</code>). Given this definition it is possible to prove some theorems, like contradiction <code>A → ¬ A → B</code>, contraposition <code>(A → B) → (¬ B → ¬ A)</code>, double negation <code>A → ¬ (¬ A)</code> and <code>¬ (¬ (¬ A)) → ¬ A</code>. Note that Agda being an intuitionistic system, the double negation elimination <code>¬ (¬ A) → A</code> is not a theorem: <em>"It's not the case that it's not raining"</em> doesn't mean <em>"it's raining"</em>, but only that the <em>rain</em> would not be contradictory.</p>

<h3>12</h3>

<p>Usually <code>in</code> is written as <code>∈</code>, but I'm short of one character</p>

<pre><code>x in P = P x
</code></pre>

<p>Types of functions from type <code>A</code> to some <code>Set _</code> can be thought of as a usual set in maths sense, set membership therefore has type <code>_∈_ : ∀ {ℓ} → A → (A → Set ℓ) → Set _</code>. Empty set is then simply <code>∅ = λ _ → ⊥</code> and the universe (the set that contains every element of type <code>A</code>) is <code>U = λ _ → ⊤</code>. Other related definitions include</p>

<pre><code>x ∉ P = ¬ x ∈ P
∁ P = λ x → x ∉ P -- complement set of P
P ⊆ Q = ∀ {x} → x ∈ P → x ∈ Q -- subset
</code></pre>

<h3>13</h3>

<pre><code>V A : ℕ → Set
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simplest data declaration for vectors (lists with size). The full definition with constructors looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>data V A : ℕ → Set where
    []  : V A zero
    _∷_ : ∀ {n} → A → V A n → V A (succ n)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that it's a dependent type, it depends on the value of type <code>ℕ</code>! Now the function like <code>head</code> which returns the first element of a vector can be defined without worrying about empty vector case, we just give it a type that works only with non-empty vectors like so</p>

<pre><code>head : ∀ {n} → V A (succ n) → A
head (a ∷ as) = a
</code></pre>

<div id="pu227" class="pu"><h1>C++</h1>

<p>With its preprocessor, templates, lambdas, type traits and countless other complex features that no one can ever hope to understand in its entirety, C++ is rediscovered by each new generation of its standard. By exploiting its numerous ways to do things at compile time, one can write zero overhead abstractions like a library that allows physical units being attached to numeric datatypes in order to check their soundness at compile time (e.g. you can not assign the outcome of <code>kg</code>*<code>m</code> to <code>N</code>)</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>#
</code></pre>

<p>Usually introducing a preprocessor statement, <code>#</code> can stand on a line on its own. It essentially means nothing and seems to be so unknown that most syntax highlighters I see don't know it.</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>%:
</code></pre>

<p>Of course not everyone has a <code>#</code> key, so C++ is (well, it really inherited it from ancient C) generous to allow you to write it with this alternative token (aka <em>digraph</em>)</p>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<pre><code>??=
</code></pre>

<p>This is a historical course on C++. These days not necessarily valid anymore, though implementations can support them, are trigraphs. This sequence is translated into <code>#</code> on those systems that support it, but to not interfere with raw string literals, it is not allowed within those. Implementations may chose to drop support alltogether.</p>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<pre><code>auto
</code></pre>

<p>Is one of the newer (since C++11) inventions to make working with generic code easy. It is for deducing the type of an expression, and since C++14 it can even be used for deducing lambda parameters and the return type of functions.</p>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<pre><code> catch
</code></pre>

<p>Is a keyword that is also known from many other languages, present in C++, but the good idiomatic C++ programmer does almost never use it. With its constructors and destructors idiomatic C++ uses a principle widely called RAII (Resource Acquisition is Initialization) or how I like to sometimes call it more appropriately: SBRM (Scope Bound Resource Management). Due to classes like smart pointers, one can tie the lifetime of dynamically allocated resources (that is not only memory!) to other objects. When those go out of scope (e.g. by a thrown exception), these objects automatically clean up resources. This allows for exception safe and easy to use code that doesn't need to use <code>catch</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 6</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strike><code>[](){}</code></strike></p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>[]{}()
</code></pre>

<p>As stefan mentioned in the comments, you can use <code>[]{}</code> as the shortest lambda object, thus this is the shortest form to <em>call</em> a lambda. The following text is for the old version:</p>

<p>is probably the shortest form of a lambda. Lambdas in C++ are objects (of implementation defined type) that are able to capture part of the scope they are created in (the [] syntax controls this), and are callable (the () syntax controls this). Their code (The {} part) has access to these variables as if they were within their scope. With their optional return type deduction and auto parameter deduction introduced in C++14, they are <em>the</em> tool to use for all the standard library algorithms that expect a callable (e.g. the third std::sort parameter).</p>

<h2>Length 7</h2>

<pre><code>virtual
</code></pre>

<p>Is the keyword to start using runtime polymorphism in C++, one of the basic blocks of object oriented programming. This follows the "don't pay for what you don't use" principle, wheras in other languages all functions are virtual by default. Being a multi paradigm language, it might be a surprise for people thinking "C++ is object oriented" to see programs or libraries that make almost no use of this keyword, e.g. because they follow the generic programming principle.</p>

<h2>Length 8</h2>

<pre><code>override
</code></pre>

<p>Working together with the virtual keyword, <code>override</code> is one of the later additions to C++ to make the compiler do more work for you. By using it, you express the intention of overriding a virtual function in the base class, and the compiler will error out if you did a mistake and that class doesn't have the specified function. In general it is considered good style if your code expresses the intention, rather than fiddle with bits.</p>

<h2>Length 9</h2>

<pre><code>constexpr
</code></pre>

<p>Being also a later addition to C++, <code>constexpr</code> allows the programmer to express for functions or variables, that they are known at compile time and should be computable at compile time. This allows these functions to be used in contexts that need compile time expressions (e.g. as template parameters or array sizes). Many standard library functions (if possible) are already constexpr so they can be used here.</p>

<h2>Length 10</h2>

<pre><code>for(i:c){}
</code></pre>

<p>Is a complete loop over a container, or container like construct that supports <code>std::begin</code> and <code>std::end</code> to get iterators (that includes C style arrays). It is basically equivalent to <code>for(auto __i = std::begin(c); __i != std::end(c); ++__i){ auto&amp; i = *__i; }</code>. This allows for easy looping in generic code.</p>

<h2>Length 11</h2>

<pre><code>void f()&amp;&amp;;
</code></pre>

<p>Is a new way to declare member functions and the properties on the object they can be called on. In previous versions of C++ we only had the ability to chose <code>void f() const;</code> to tell the compiler to be able to call the function on const objects (thus without the const you can not call them on non-const objects). The same way we now have the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> syntax for r-value references being used to be able to call those functions on rvalues.</p>

<h2>Length 12</h2>

<pre><code>int main(){}
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably the shortest complete program that you can compile link and run. It will do nothing and return 0. This return is one of the many special cases you can encounter in C++. Normally returning nothing is undefined behaviour, but for the entry point function main, returning nothing means returning 0. </p>

<h2>Length 13</h2>

<pre><code>auto f()-&gt;int
</code></pre>

<p>is a rather new way to declare the return type of a function. Normally you would not do this if you already know the type, but there are plenty of situations in generic programming where the type depends on template parameters and the variables you use. Doing it this way allows for a somewhat easier access to these parameters as in <code>template&lt;class T&gt; auto f( const T&amp; t ) -&gt; decltype(t.foo())</code> instead of <code>template&lt;class T&gt; decltype(std::declval&lt;T&gt;().foo()) g( const T&amp; t ) { return t.foo(); }</code></p>

<div id="pu228" class="pu"><h1>Forth</h1>

<p>Forth has only two types, ints and floats (and the floats are optional!) but it still manages to have chars, strings, long long ints, pointers, function pointers, structs, and more; it's all in how you use it!</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<p><code>.</code></p>

<p>The <code>.</code> command (or "word" as we call it) prints out the integer value on top of the data stack; if the stack is empty, you get a runtime error.  It also remove the value from the stack — upvote to see how we can keep it!</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<p><code>.s</code></p>

<p>The <code>.s</code> word displays the values currently on the stack, without removing any of them.  It also displays the total number of values.  In Gforth, <code>.s</code> is limited by default to only showing the top 9 values; maybe we'll find out how to show more?</p>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<p><code>see</code></p>

<p>Type <code>see</code> followed by any Forth word to see that word's source code.  Most Forth words are defined in Forth itself, and only a few primitives are defined in assembly.</p>

<h2>Length 4</h2>

<p><code>1 0=</code></p>

<p>Did I mention that Forth is a stack-based language with postfix operators?  Typing <code>1 0=</code> pushes <code>1</code> onto the stack and then executes the <code>0=</code> word, which pops the top value off the stack and pushes <code>true</code> if it equals 0, <code>false</code> if it doesn't.  <code>0=</code> is a convenience word for <code>0 =</code>; there are several shorthand words like it for common value+word combinations, like <code>1+</code> and <code>0&lt;&gt;</code>.  Moreover, while <code>false</code> in Forth is 0 and any nonzero value is true, the built-in test words return <code>true</code> for true results, and <code>true</code> goes all the way — it's the value with all bits set, i.e., <code>-1</code>!</p>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<p><code>-1 u.</code></p>

<p>Push <code>-1</code> onto the stack, then pop it off and print it as an unsigned integer.  This can be used to quickly see the maximum value for an unsigned int on your version of Forth (but not the maximum integral value that it natively supports!).  You may be asking, "How do we know when an int should be printed with <code>.</code> and when with <code>u.</code>?"  Answer: <code>.</code> when it's signed, <code>u.</code> when unsigned.  "That's not what I meant," you say.  "How do we know when the value on top of the stack is signed and when it's unsigned?"  Answer: You're the programmer — that's your job!  You have to know whether each integer on the stack represents an int, an unsigned int, an <code>int*</code>, a <code>char*</code>, a function pointer, or other, or else you get the demons in your nose.  Forth's not going to keep track of that for you; what is this, C?</p>

<h2>Length 6</h2>

<p><code>." Hi"</code></p>

<p>Prints <code>Hi</code>.  <code>."</code> is a Forth word (which, like all Forth words, must be followed by whitespace or EOF) that reads the input stream up through the next <code>"</code> and prints out any bytes in between.  If you put more than one space after the <code>."</code>, all but the space immediately after the <code>."</code> will be printed.  Escape sequences are not supported (so you can't print a string with a <code>"</code> in it with <code>."</code>), but Gforth adds <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Displaying-characters-and-strings.html#index-g_t_002e_005c_0022-_0040var_007b-compilation-_0027ccc_0022_0027-_002d_002d-_003b-run_002dtime-_002d_002d---_007d--gforth-2013"><code>.\"</code></a> to the language, which does support them.</p>

<h2>Length 7</h2>

<p><code>: + - ;</code></p>

<p>You define your own words in Forth by writing a colon, the name of the word, the words that you want your word to execute, and a semicolon.  A word can be any sequence of non-whitespace characters (whitespace is how Forth tells where one word ends and another begins, after all), even punctuation, and even operators (which are just words, after all).  The above snippet redefines <code>+</code> to mean <code>-</code>, so now whenever you try to add, you subtract instead.  Any pre-existing words that use <code>+</code> are unaffected, as they store a reference to the original definition of <code>+</code>.</p>

<p>Note: Some words do different things inside definitions of other words than they do outside, but other than control structures, they're all pretty esoteric.  Most words do the same thing inside a definition as outside, but sometimes that thing isn't obvious — <code>: show-see see see ;</code> won't do what you think!</p>

<h2>Length 8</h2>

<p><code>: 42 - ;</code></p>

<p>When I said a word could be any sequence of whitespace characters, I meant <em>any</em> sequence.  No, Forth does not have a word for each individual number; numbers are just a little special.  When Forth encounters a non-whitespace sequence, it first sees if it's a known word; if it's not, it tries to parse it as a number; if that fails, only then do you get an error.  Defining a word that's spelled the same as a number means that you won't be able to enter that spelling of the number directly anymore without getting the word instead, but <a href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Number-Conversion.html">Gforth and various other Forths give you multiple ways to spell numbers anyway</a>.</p>

<h2>Length 9</h2>

<p><code>IF 1 THEN</code></p>

<p><em>Finally</em>, something familiar!  Obviously, this code tests whether its argument <code>1</code> is true and, if so, executes whatever's after the <code>THEN</code>, right?  Wrong.  When execution reaches the <code>IF</code>, the value on top of the stack is popped off, and if <em>that</em> value is true (i.e., nonzero), execution continues with whatever's inside the <code>IF ... THEN</code> and then whatever's after the <code>THEN</code>; if the value is zero, we just skip straight to after <code>THEN</code>.  Note that, due to how these words are implemented internally (which is in terms of other Forth words!), <code>IF</code> and <code>THEN</code> can only be used inside a word definition, not in "interpret state."</p>

<h2>Length 12</h2>

<p><code>( x y -- y )</code></p>

<p>This is a comment.  It goes from the <code>(</code> to the next <code>)</code> immediately after it.  (In the interpreter, a newline can also end it.)  This is not "built in" to Forth's syntax (Is anything?); <code>(</code> is just another word, one that discards everything in the input stream up through the next <code>)</code>.  (That's right — Forth can manipulate how its source code is read.  Perl's not the only language that can't be parsed without executing it!)  Since it's a word, you have to follow it with a space, or else Forth will complain that <code>(x</code> is undefined.  We can also redefine <code>(</code> as part of our ongoing campaign of shooting ourselves in the foot.</p>

<p>The comment's content is more interesting, however.  This comment specifices the <em>stack effect</em> for some word; the part to the left of the <code>--</code> lists what should be on the top of the stack before you run the word (the top is on the right), and the right side of the <code>--</code> describes what the top of the stack will look like afterwards (again, the top is on the right).  Common convention is to add such a comment to the source of any word you define, right after the <code>: name</code> bit, and there is also a very strong convention about <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Notation.html#index-types-of-stack-items-171">naming stack elements to indicate their type</a> that is even followed by <a href="https://www.taygeta.com/forth/dpans.html">the standard</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the stack effect shown is for the <code>nip</code> word.  You should be able to tell what it does just from the comment.</p>

<h2>Length 13</h2>

<p><code>1 2 3 4 d+ d.</code></p>

<p>As previously indicated, a Forth value's type is all in how you use it — if you treat a value as a pointer, it's a pointer, and if that value's not a <em>good</em> pointer, it's your fault for treating it as one.  However, regardless of what type you're treating a value as, it will always take up one cell on the data stack; the exceptions are <em>double cell</em> or <em>double precision integers</em>.  These are integers that are represented by two values on the stack, allowing you to perform arithmetic with twice as many bits as usual.  The more significant or higher-bit cell is placed on top of the less significant or lower-bit one, so that <code>1 0</code> is the double cell representation of <code>1</code>, and <code>0 1</code> is either 2^32 or 2^64, depending on how big your Forth's regular cells are.  Naturally, in order to treat a double-cell value as such, we need to use words that explicitly operate on double-cell values; these are generally just <code>d</code> (or <code>ud</code> for unsigned) followed by the name of the corresponding single-cell word: <code>d+</code> for addition, <code>d&lt;</code> for comparison, <code>d.</code> for printing, etc.</p>

</p>

<pre><code>typedef C(a);   
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the <code>typedef</code> keyword to assign a name to a function type. Here, <code>C</code> defines a function that takes a single argument. Now we can refer to <code>C</code> where we a need a function with that signature:</p>

<pre class="lang-dart prettyprint-override"><code>k(C c) =&gt; c;
</code></pre>

<p>And calling <code>k</code>:</p>

<pre><code>k((a) =&gt; 4);

<p>This is all very similar to the previous snippet, but can simplify things greatly if we need to continuously refer to a function type.</p>

<p><strong>Length 12:</strong>
</p>

<pre><code>a(b()) =&gt; b;

<p>Dart functions are first class. Here <code>a</code> is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns it. You could call <code>a</code> like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-dart prettyprint-override"><code>a(() =&gt; 4);

<p>The <code>as</code> keyword allows you to cast an object to any type, in this case the variable <code>a</code> is cast to type <code>B</code>. This is very useful when you know the type of an object returned by a dynamic method and want the tooling to reflect that. For instance, if you were working with HTML and queried the DOM for an element, you could specify the type of the element, even though that type is not actually returned:</p>

<pre><code>(10, "Z")
</code></pre>

<p>Tuples! a <strong>Tuple</strong> is defined as a comma separated collection of values. While <strong>Lists</strong> (and <strong>Arrays</strong>) gravitate towards the concept of a <em>Set</em>, Tuples are more like a data <em>structure</em> that groups related values.</p>

<p>The snippet defines a 2-tuple. One value is integer, the other string. F# annotates the type as: <code>int * string</code></p>

<p>Tuples are considered ad hoc types, so they are passed as a single argument, can be a return type and so on. </p>

<p>F# has two built in functions to help with tuples: <code>fst</code> and <code>snd</code> that return the first or second element of a Tuple respectively. Tuples are not limited to just two elements, though.</p>

<p><strong>Length 8 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>[-9..10]
</code></pre>

<p>F# allows to define ranges of sequential values. This snippet generates a list of 20 integer elements, -9 and 10 inclusive.</p>

<p>You can define stepping values, for example <code>[0..10..50]</code> will yield a list of 6 elements: <strong>[0; 10; 20; 30; 40; 50]</strong>.</p>

<p>The range syntax is the same for lists and arrays.</p>

<p><strong>Length 7 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>let a=1
</code></pre>

<p>We can now define <strong>values</strong>. Values in F# are immutable by default, that is the reason we avoid the use of the term "variable".</p>

<p>The snippet defines an immutable value "a" that contains a 1 (integer).</p>

<p><strong>Length 6 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>2.**8.

<p>Now we can use the Power function.</p>

<p>Note that I could not call the Power function before with arguments "2" and "8", because [the arguments] would be considered integers. The decimal points make the compiler to infer a floating point number. This snippet correctly returns a 256.0 (float) value.</p>

<p>Floats in F# are double precision.</p>

<p><strong>Length 5 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>[|0|]
</code></pre>

<p>At five characters, we can define an array with one element (as mentioned before, the compiler infers the type to <code>int[]</code>). </p>

<p>Not to be confused with a list. An empty list is defined simply by the square brackets like this: <code>[]</code></p>

<p>The element separator, in both lists and arrays, is the semicolon (<code>;</code>) as in <code>[| 1;2;3 |]</code></p>

<p><strong>Length 4 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>(**)
</code></pre>

<p>It's not an emoticon, it is a multi-line comment in F#. For some odd reason I didn't find this syntax intuitive. I got used to it until much later.</p>

<p>Single-line comments are double-slash (<code>//</code>), just like C++, C#, Java, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Length 3 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>nan
</code></pre>

<p>Three characters unlocks many basic arithmetic operations (<strong>1+2</strong>, <strong>9*9</strong> and so on). But I picked <code>nan</code>. It is a shortcut function that simply returns System.Double.NaN. </p>

<p>Useful to compare (or match) the result of a function.</p>

<p><strong>Length 2 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>;;
</code></pre>

<p>I could've used an empty string (<code>""</code>) as the snippet. That would create a function that returns an empty string, but it is the same concept as the length 1 snippet.</p>

<p>Instead, I picked the empty statement in <strong>F# Interactive (FSI)</strong>. FSI is a REPL tool that allows you to declare, construct and otherwise experiment with your code in an interactive manner and it is very useful. In my opinion, the <code>;;</code> is used more frequently than empty strings.</p>

<p>You must append double semicolons (<code>;;</code>) at the end of your statements in FSI to indicate the end of input.</p>

<p><strong>Length 1 Snippet</strong></p>

<pre><code>0
</code></pre>

<p>A function that returns zero (the compiler infers the type to integer). Commonly used as the final statement to return the program exit code.</p>

<p><strong>Factoid</strong>: F# uses type inference. The programmer does not need to declare types - the compiler deduces types during compilation.</p>

<div id="pu233" class="pu"><h1>GNU Make</h1>
<p>I'll go out on a limb on this one.  I think this may well be the first time that <code>make</code> has been featured in PPCG.</p>
<h3>Factoid</h3>
<p><a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/Computation.html#Makefile-functional" rel="noreferrer">Make may be considered to be a functional language.</a></p>
<h3>Length 0 snippet</h3>
<p>I don't think length 0 snippets are required, but here is one anyway.  I think this might be the most useful of all length 0 programs.  With an empty Makefile (or even no makefile at all), make still has a bunch of built-in rules.  E.g. there are default built-in rules to compile a .c file into a .o or binary, given the .c file exists in the current directory.  So if we do:</p>
<pre><code>make hello.o
</code></pre>
<p>make will find the .c to .o rule and compile hello.c to give hello.o</p>
<p>Similarly if we do:</p>
<pre><code>make goodbye
</code></pre>
<p>If there is a goodbye.c file in the current directory it will be compiled into the goodbye binary.</p>
<h3>Length 1 Snippet</h3>
<p><kbd>TAB</kbd></p>
<p>Yes, the TAB character.  While this doesn't do much on its own, it has great significance in Make.  Specifically all recipe lines following a target definition in a rule MUST start with a TAB.  This causes all sorts of frustrations when debugging makefiles when TABs and spaces get mixed up.</p>
<h3>Length 2 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$@
</code></pre>
<p>This is an automatic variable for use in recipes.  It will expand to the filename of the target of the rule.  There are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables" rel="noreferrer">other useful automatic variables</a>.</p>
<h3>Length 3 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>a:=
</code></pre>
<p>Shortest simply expanded variable assignment.  The variable a is set to &quot;&quot; immediately when the Makefile is first parsed.  If instead we do <code>a=</code>, then the assignment is recursively expanded, i.e. expansion is deferred until the time the variable is actually referenced.</p>
<h3>Length 4 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>W:;w
</code></pre>
<p>Shortest marginally useful complete rule specification.  This defines a target <code>W</code> with a rule that simply runs the <code>w</code> shell command.  Thus</p>
<pre><code>make W
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>w
</code></pre>
<p>This is an alternative rule syntax in that the recipe follows the target on the same line separated by a new line.  More commonly the recipe lines immediately follow a separate target line, with <kbd>TAB</kbd> characters starting each recipe line.</p>
<h3>Length 5 Snippet</h3>
<pre><code>$(@D)
</code></pre>
<p>Another automatic variable.  Similar to <code>$@</code>, but this expands to the directory portion of path, with the filename and trailing / removed.</p>

<div id="pu234" class="pu"><h2>IBM Enterprise COBOL</h2>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Whilst it is possible (twists and turns) to have a useful two-character program (to be the target of a CALL to a sub-program which doesn't otherwise exist yet), other than variations of the same thing, the next one would come in at 26 characters, and would be a variation which... doesn't work.</p>

<p>Plus that is not counting the mandatory seven blanks at the start of a line. And it would be severely abusing the language. </p>

<p>COBOL's not really so good for this challenge.</p>

<p>This is becoming interesting in itself. Although it will be a while before I can get the program to do something else, it is an interesting academic voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>Remembering that these are short, and abused, programs it is interesting that only valid COBOL can be ignored, if invalid it gets an S-level diagnostic, which is going too far. Some actually valid COBOL will not work without a full-stop/period, as I've noticed when trying to Golf(!) things previously.</p>

<p><strong>Two characters</strong></p>

<p>Excellent. Here's the two-character example. Remembering, sorry about that, that it must be preceded by seven blanks.</p>

<pre><code>   ID
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't look like much of a program. Certainly not much of a COBOL program. You do have to bend things a little.</p>

<p>Compile it, and these are the diagnostic messages you get:</p>

<pre><code> 1  IGYDS1102-E   Expected "DIVISION", but found "END OF PROGRAM".
 "DIVISION" was assumed before "END OF PROGRAM". 

 1  IGYDS1082-E   A period was required.  A period was assumed 
 before "END OF PROGRAM". 

                  Same message on line:      1 

 1  IGYDS1003-E   A "PROGRAM-ID" paragraph was not found. 
 Program-name "CBLNAM01" was assumed. 
</code></pre>

<p>That gets you a Return Code/Condition Code of eight. Normally you wouldn't generate the code for, or attempt to execute, a program with an RC/CC higher than four. However, none of those messages affect the generated code (except the allocation of a Program-name).</p>

<p>What does the program do? When it is CALLed, it simply returns to where it was called from, in the normal manner.</p>

<p>How would you use it?</p>

<p>Whilst developing a program, you want to check out the control flow, but you haven't written a couple of the sub-programs yet. Simply copy the loadmodule (created by feeding the object code produced into the linkeditor/binder) to the name of the CALLed program and, assuming you are using Dynamic CALLs, you have a stub which is just going to give you back control. For a Dynamically-called program, the PROGRAM-ID (Program-name) is irrelevant, so it does not matter if you accept the generated name.</p>

<p>An equivalent "real" program would be this.</p>

<pre><code>   ID DIVISION.

<p>This program defines a group-item (valid for this purpose) but it is discarded.</p>

<p>Program operates as above.</p>

<p><strong>Four characters</strong></p>

<p>Since it is COBOL, we should see a full-stop/period at some time. Now.</p>

<pre><code>   1 A.
</code></pre>

<p>Even though the line is discarded, it gets one less diagnostic because the program source now ends with a full-stop/period. </p>

<p><strong>Five characters</strong></p>

<p>We're up to five votes, so here's a five character program that is equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>   ID FD
</code></pre>

<p>This operates in exactly the same way as the two-character example. FD is valid COBOL, so the compiler realises there is some stuff missing. Without it being valid COBOL, there would be an S-level message, and an RC/CC of 12. With it being a valid COBOL word, but obviously out of place, the third messages shows that it is just ignored.</p>

<p>A little more interesting this time. That "Same message on line:      1" looks odd (as the other message it is the same as is also line 1) but that is because we only have a one-line program and there are two required full-stops/periods (should be one after the SECTION which isn't there and one to end the source program).</p>

<h2>Length 14 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>}0}1
Mulx
HxHx
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet shows off some more of Marbelous libraries and introduces a new concept, namely, multi-cell boards. The <code>Mulx</code> board takes two marbles as input and outputs 2 marbles. Marbles that enter the leftmost cell of the <code>Mulx</code> will correspond to the <code>}0</code> devices in that board and the rightmost cell to <code>}1</code>. Analogously, the outputs will come out of different cells as well. The width of a board can be calculated as <code>MAX(1, highest output device + 1, highest input device + 1)</code> cells that don't correspond to an input device will trash any marble that falls upon them.</p>

<h2>Length 13 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>7E
??
&gt;Y!!
{0
</code></pre>

<p>This is a board that will spit out a random printable ascii character on each tick. Marbelous has two ways of generating random values. There is <code>??</code> which returns a random value between 0 and the input marble it receives, inclusive, and <code>?n</code>: <code>?0</code> up to <code>?Z</code> respectively. Which act very similar to <code>??</code>. We also have <code>!!</code> which terminates the board even if not all outputs are filled. Can you figure out how the <code>?n</code> devices could be implemented as boards in Marbelous using <code>??</code>?</p>

<h2>Length 12 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>}0}1
Fb//
Dp
</code></pre>

<p>Here we see a few library functions of Marbelous in action.
<code>Fb</code> outputs the nth fibonacci number where n is the input marble. <code>Dp</code> prints the input marble to STDOUT as a decimal number. These are both implemented in Marbelous and can be called upon when you check include libraries in <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/40073/making-future-posts-runnable-online-with-stack-snippets/40808#40808">the online interpreter</a>, for the python interpreter, you have to explicitely include each file. The inplementation of these boards can be found <a href="https://github.com/marbelous-lang" rel="nofollow noreferrer">on github</a>. Note that this particular program takes 2 inputs and will call the Fibonacci board two times. Boards that are called are return within one tick of the board that called them.</p>

<h2>Length 11 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>}0}0
{&lt;{0{&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This one needs some explanation. The <code>}0</code> devices are imputs, since they have the same number (0), they will contain the same value when this board gets called. The three devices on the lower row are outputs. <code>{&lt;</code> outputs to the left of the board, <code>{0</code> outputs underneath the first cell of the board and <code>{&gt;</code> outputs to the right. Output is only pushed when all distinct output devices are filled. In this case however, the right output device is never reached. The board will exit because of lack of activity and output the two values it has anyway. Can you imagine how one could implement <code>/\</code> as a Marbelous board?</p>

<h2>Length 10 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>..40
FF
\\
</code></pre>

<p>There's a few things that play an important role in Marbelous here. Firstly, there's addition. If you trace the path of the two marbles on the board, you'll notice that they'll end up on the same cell at the same time. When this happens, they'll be added together. (fun fact: at some point it was considered that instead of being added together, the marbles should form a stack) However, Marbelous is an 8 bit language, So adding a marble to <code>FF</code> is equivalent to subtracting 1 from it.</p>

<h2>Length 9 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>00
\\/\]]
</code></pre>

<p>This is the shortest way to implement a rudimentary version of cat in Marbelous.
    00
    \/\
Is a loop that puts a <code>00</code>value marble on the <code>]]</code> device every second tick. This is an STDIN device. When a marble lands on this device, it tries to read the first character from STDIN, if there is one, it gets pushed down (and in this case printed again). If there isn't one, The original amrble gets pushed to the right. (and in this case trashed)</p>

<h2>Length 8 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>}0
~~
{0
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet shows a few features. Firstly it takes input through }0. In this case this is the Main Board and this will be replaced by the command line input. You can also call this function, in that case, the argument will be taken instead of the command line input. Then there's <code>~~</code>, which is a bitwise not operator. After that, we get to <code>}0</code>, If all <code>}n</code> devices are filled, these values are returned as the functions return values. (Marbelous supports more than one return value per function) </p>

<h2>Length 7 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>00
\\/\
</code></pre>

<p>This is the most compact infinite loop you can create in Marbelous. The <code>\\</code> device pushes any marble to the right, <code>/\</code> copies a marble and pushes one copy to the left and another to the right. Since the board is only two cells wide, the marble to the right gets trashed though.</p>

<h2>Length 6 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>46MB75
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example of recursion, <code>MB</code> (the implicitly named main board gets called on every tick, but not before Printing <code>Fu</code> to STDOUT on each call. (Resulting in the following: <code>FuFuFuFuFuFu...</code> This obviously overflows the callstack.</p>

<h2>Length 5 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>2A
++
</code></pre>

<p>Some arithmetic, The marble with value <code>2A</code> falls down on teh first tick and the finds itself on the <code>++</code> cell. This is an operator. This particular operator increments any marble that land on it and lets it fall down. The marble now has value <code>2B</code> and falls off the board. This prints <code>+</code> to STDOUT.</p>

<h2>Length 4 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>:
24
</code></pre>

<p>The two interpreters disagree here, I've given the first board of the file a name in this example (The name is an empty string). The python interpreter assumes this is the Main board and calls this board upon running the program (which prints <code>$</code>). The javascript interpreter doesn't find the Main Board and thus no entry point. This can be useful when writing a library file for Marbelous.</p>

<h2>Length 3 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>:Bo
</code></pre>

<p>This is a named board, with no body, we can call this board by Writing <code>Bo</code> in a cell of any board (including <code>Bo</code> itself)</p>

<h2>Length 2 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>3A
</code></pre>

<p>This code is the body of a 1x1 cell (each cell is two characters wide) board, implicitly named <code>MB</code> (for Main Board). It prints the ascii value of the hexadecimal value of <code>3A</code> when the marble falls off the board. The output of this program just so happens to be the source code of:</p>

<h2>Length 1 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>:
</code></pre>

<p>Along with <code>#</code>, this is one of the two the only valid 1 character programs in marbelous. <code>#</code> is an indicator of a comment an therefor not very interesting. <code>:</code> tells marbelous that you're about to declare a board. Neither of teh two compilers care that you don't actually name or define the board. The program doesn't do anything.</p>

<div id="pu236" class="pu"><h1><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)">Delphi</a> (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal">Object PASCAL</a>)</h1>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Over the years the name of Delphi changed prefixes many times. Beginning with <em>Borland Delphi</em>. This name held for ~13 years until it got renamed to <em>Embarcadero Delphi</em> in 2008 (as you may assume <em>Embarcadero</em> bought Delphi).<br>
 The code is similar to C++, but is more object oriented and is translated from PASCAL to C++ during compilation. Recent versions are also able to generate applications for <em>all</em> major OSes including Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and even iOS.</p>

<p><em>Downsides are:</em> Delphi is built together with VCL (Visual Component Library) which slows down the performance of graphic-heavy applications a lot (every change of properties of a visual object will cause a redraw of the component), but the IDE is even simpler to use (drag and drop of components).</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  
  <p>Because a line-ending semicolon (<code>;</code>) is optional before a closing <code>end;</code> tag, I may omit it to save characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Length 1:</h2>

<pre><code>;
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, I know. It's very basic, but is compiled without throwing errors, warnings etc.<br>
It will be compiled into a simple <code>NOP</code> statement doing nothing.<br>
This may be helpful, if the IDE removes empty procedures, to make sure you remember to program them.</p>

<h2>Length 2:</h2>

<h2>1:</h2>

<pre><code>D;
</code></pre>

<p>This will simply run the procedure <code>D</code> without any arguments. In Delphi there is no distinction of lower- and uppercase names (functions, procedures, variables even files in the compiler directive) and functions or procedures (two different types of jumping to code and returning back) can be called as well as be declared without braces (<code>()</code>) if they don't request parameters.<br>
<sub>This above means, that the procedure/function could be called either <code>d</code> or <code>D</code> and could be declared with or without braces. The compiler takes care of managing this.</sub></p>

<h2>2:</h2>

<pre><code>L:
</code></pre>

<p>This places a label at the current location. You can then use <code>goto L;</code> to jump to that label, which allows skipping code or alternative loops.<br>
You just need to make sure that you declared the label in the <em>function/procedure</em> head (<code>label L;</code>)</p>

<h2>Length 3:</h2>

<pre><code>asm
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, Delphi allows inline assembly code!<br>
This snippet is the opening tag for assembly code, but have to close it with <code>end;</code> of course else it will spam compiler errors.<br>
Inside the <code>asm [...] end;</code> block you can use your beloved assembly with all the variables used in usual Delphi.</p>

<h2>Length 4:</h2>

<pre><code>Date
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Time
</code></pre>

<p>Those two are <em>functions</em> returning the actual date or time of the day of the type <code>TDateTime</code>. Funny enough <code>TDateTime</code> is just an alias for <code>Double</code> with no changes <em>at all</em>. Using <code>DateToStr</code> or <code>TimeToStr</code> every <code>Double</code> can be converted into the actual Date/Time.</p>

<h2>Length 5:</h2>

<pre><code>Free;
</code></pre>

<p>Bam! This procedure frees the current object (ie. safely destroying it). If you do it on one of your forms this closes the window but keeps the process (event queue, primary thread etc.) running. If an object is currently being created, calling <code>Free;</code> will throw an access violation error.</p>

<h2>Length 6:</h2>

<pre><code>goto l
</code></pre>

<p>(Assume <code>l</code> is an already defined and set label)<br>
Tired of <code>while True do</code> loops? Use <code>label</code>s and <code>goto</code>s!<br>
If you put a call in the line before an <code>end;</code> you don't need a line-ending <code>;</code> (semicolon). Very handy.</p>

<h2>Length 7:</h2>

<pre><code>Swap(8)
</code></pre>

<p>Some bitwise operations, yay! This <em>function</em> swaps the first half of a SmallInt (16 bits) and the second half. Example: 8 (0000 0000 | 0000 1000) becomes 2048 (0000 1000 | 0000 0000).<br>
It doesn't matter which size the integer actually has, it gets converted to a <em>SmallInt</em> by truncating/filling with zeros.</p>

<p>Funny side-note: Usually all functions are declared anywhere, especially when exploring their declaration, but <code>Swap</code> (as well as a few others) are not found in the source of their declaration file (<em>System.pas</em>) but the declaration is displayed correctly.</p>

<h2>Length 8:</h2>

<pre><code>Repaint;
</code></pre>

<p>If you call this in a component's thread (which is usually your main thread), this will schedule all child components and itself for repainting. This is usually not needed, but if you modify components outside of the main thread (eg. in a secondary thread) the components do not get invalidated nor repainted, thus needing this <em>procedure</em>.
<sub>This <em>procedure</em> also has an alias called <code>Refresh;</code>.</sub></p>

<h2>Length 9:</h2>

<p>1:</p>

<pre><code>Trim(' ')
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>function</em> takes a string and <em>trims</em> (ie. removes) all leading/following spaces (no other character(s)) and returns the trimmed string.<br>
There are even <em>functions</em> to <em>trim</em> only one side (left or right).</p>

<p>2:</p>

<pre><code>{Comment}
</code></pre>

<p>Right, Delphi doesn't use curly brackets in code, but rather as the opening/closing tag of a comment. There are <em>two</em> types of declaring a comment:</p>

<ol>
<li>curly brackets like above (<code>{}</code>).<br>
They allow multi-line comments. You can replace those curly brackets with <code>(* *)</code>, if you are not able to use those.</li>
<li>double forward slashes (<code>//</code>).<br>
Many languages feature them, so does Delphi. The end of the comment is the next line break, so use this for small notes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Length 10:</h2>

<pre><code>{$R *.dfm}
</code></pre>

<p>"What is this?", you might think. It seems like a comment I just characterised above.
But it isn't;<br>
it's a compiler directive! It tells the compiler to add a file named the same as this <em>Unit</em> (that's how source files are called in <em>Delphi</em>), but with the extension <code>.dfm</code>, which is the common file type of a form.<br>
Compiler directives can be identified by the <code>$</code> as the first character in curly brackets.</p>

<h2>Length 11:</h2>

<pre><code>SendToBack;
</code></pre>

<p>Some more things you can do with windows/forms you have control of (which should be all of them; unless the system denies permission, which may happen on windows owned by processes of the <em>System</em> user).<br>
This <em>procedure</em> will put the window to the back of the stack without losing focus. This may be useful for something, but hiding a form/window moves the focus to the next one and doesn't keep the actual window open and focused.</p>

<p>Factoid: T-SQL is in fact Turing-Complete and can be proven (given enough upvotes).</p>
</div>
<div id="pu238" class="pu"><h2>STATA</h2>

<p>Factoid: STATA is a statistical language that is used mainly for economics modelling.</p>

<p>Length 1:</p>

<pre><code>l
</code></pre>

<p>This lists all variables and every observation for each variable in a big table. It is shorthand for the list command and demonstrates that many commands can be shortened to save characters when golfing.</p>

<p>Length 2:</p>

<pre><code>di
</code></pre>

<p>This is short for display, which can take any number of arguments separated by space and displays them to the console. With no arguments, it just prints a new line.</p>

<p>Length 3:</p>

<pre><code>#d;
</code></pre>

<p>This is short for #delimit ; which changes the delimiter from a carriage return to a semicolon. In fact, anything but #d cr will change it to a semicolon.</p>

<p>Length 4:</p>

<pre><code>so a
</code></pre>

<p>This command sorts the data in memory by variable a in ascending order.</p>

<p>Length 5:</p>

<pre><code>cap "
</code></pre>

<p>The capture (shortenable to cap) command captures the errors that occur with other commands, including syntax errors. Here, the non-closed quote is an invalid command in STATA, but because capture is used, there is no error, and code can continue.</p>

<p>Length 6:</p>

<pre><code>drop a
</code></pre>

<p>This command removes the variable a (and all values for a for observations in the dataset). In addition, drop can be used to specify a list of variables to drop or even a list of observations (with slightly different syntax).</p>

<p>Length 7:</p>

<pre><code>l ///
a
</code></pre>

<p>Like in many languages, STATA allows comments with //. However, adding an extra / will cause the command to continue onto the next line, so here, this is equivalent to l a, which will list each observation's value for the variable a.</p>

<p><strong>7 Characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>()(1)GF
</code></pre>

<p>In Jagl, <code>F</code> is a recursive flatten. You can have many nested arrays and it will flatten them into one. Another little trick is, if you have an array of numbers (and arrays of numbers and so on), and just want to flatten one deep, you can just use <code>b</code> (the sum function) to do that.</p>

<p><strong>6 Characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>(1(1))
</code></pre>

<p>The array definition syntax in Jagl uses spaces to separate items, but in some cases, the spaces can be omitted, reducing the character count of the program. Alternatively, this could be written <code>1(1)G</code> in this case, to reduce the characters even more.</p>

<p><strong>5 Characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>5r[/B
</code></pre>

<p>Computes 5 factorial. Makes a range of 0 to 4 inclusive, increments all of the numbers by one, and pushes the product to stack.</p>

<p><strong>4 Characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>1 2G
</code></pre>

<p>It only takes one character to encase the whole stack in an array. Alternatively, using a lowercase <code>g</code> would take up to 2 values from the stack and encase them in an array!</p>

<p><strong>3 Characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>m%p
</code></pre>

<p>It only takes three characters to filter an array on the stack for all primes, and print the results</p>

<p><strong>2 Characters</strong></p>

<pre><code>T~
</code></pre>

<p>To make a self interpreter in Jagl, all it takes is two characters! (though, it would take 6 to make it loop endlessly)</p>

<p><strong>1 Character</strong></p>

<pre><code>m
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>m</code> in Jagl is the isPrime function, so it only takes a few characters to, say, print the primes from 1 to 1000.</p>

<p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Jagl was created as a high school project, and the name stands for Just A Golfing Language</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong>: An empty character class that doesn't match anything.</p>

<p><strong>PCRE</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python <code>re</code></strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> (tested on version 2.0): Syntax error.</p>

<h2>Length 1 snippet</h2>

<pre><code>.

<p><code>.</code>, called dot-all, is available in all flavors I had a chance to look at.</p>

<h3>What does it match?</h3>

<p>I̧n͟ g̨͜e҉̡͞n̵͢e͜͝r̷͝a͘l̢҉,̡͟ ̕̕<code>̴.̸́</code>̴̢̛ ̸̡̢m͞ąt̴̨c͞h̛e͢͡s̶͘ ͘a҉n̛͜͠ỳ̸ ͢c̵̡hár͘͝a̕͢ćt͘͠e͏̀͠r̷̀ ̴̕͢ex͝͞͞c҉ep̀t̛ ̕f̴҉o͟͜r̴͢ ͞n͏ę͟w̢̕͜ ͡l͝i̸̧n͢͡e̶.͟</p>

<p><strong>Java <code>Pattern</code></strong>: In default mode, dot-all matches any code point, except for these 5 code points <code>\r\n\u0085\u2028\u2029</code>. With <code>UNIX_LINES</code> mode on (but without <code>DOTALL</code>), dot-all matches any code point, except for <code>\n</code>. With <code>DOTALL</code> mode on, dot-all matches any code point. From Java 5, <code>Pattern</code> operates on code point, so astral characters are matched by dot-all.</p>

<p><strong>Python <code>re</code></strong> (tested on 2.7.8 and 3.2.5, may be different on 3.3+): In default mode, dot-all matches any UTF-16 code unit (0000 to FFFF inclusive), except for <code>\n</code>. <code>re.DOTALL</code> lifts the exception and makes <code>.</code> matches any UTF-16 code unit. In these versions, <code>re</code> operates on UTF-16 code units, so <code>.</code> only manages to match one code unit of characters in astral plane.</p>

<p><strong>.NET</strong>: Same as Python. The dot-all mode in .NET is called <code>Singleline</code>.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript (C++11 <code>&lt;regex&gt;</code>)</strong>: In default mode, dot-all matches any UTF-16 code unit, except for these 4 code points <code>\n\r\u2028\u2029</code>. With <code>s</code> flag on, dot-all matches any UTF-16 code unit. JavaScript also operates on UTF-16 code units.</p>

<p><strong>PCRE</strong>: Depending on build option, dot-all can exclude <code>\r</code>, <code>\n</code> or <code>\r\n</code>, or all 3 CR LF sequences, or any Unicode newline sequence in default mode. In default mode, the engine operates on code unit (can be 8, 16, or 32-bit code unit), so dot-all matches any code unit, except for the newline sequences. In UTF mode, the engine operates on code point, so dot-all matches any code point except for newline sequences. The dot-all mode is called <code>PCRE_DOTALL</code>.</p>

<p><strong>PHP</strong> (tested on ideone): PCRE, compiled as UTF-8 library and <code>\n</code> is the only newline sequence by default. Dot-all mode is accessible via <code>s</code> flag.</p>

<p><strong>Postgres</strong>: In default mode, dot-all matches any code point without exception.</p>

<p><strong>Ruby</strong> (tested on version 2.0.0): In default mode, <code>.</code> matches any code point except for <code>\n</code>. Dot-all mode is accessible via <code>m</code> flag (!).</p>

<p><sup><code>s</code> flag is used to indicate Windows-31J encoding in Ruby.</sup></p>

<div id="pu241" class="pu"><h1>Prelude</h1>
<p>Prelude is an esoteric language with 9 instructions, plus the numeric literals 0 through 9. It was created as an ASCII representation of a music-based language called Fugue, which for some strange reason has not been implemented.</p>
<h1>Prelude</h1>
<p><strong>Length 5</strong></p>
<pre><code> v
^#
</code></pre>
<p>This is a 2-dimensional code snippet, so I'm not sure if the newline should count. Anyway, what it does is to duplicate the top of the first line's stack. The <code>^</code> instruction makes a copy of the top of the above line's stack. <code>v</code> copies the top of the below line's stack. <code>#</code> destroys the number on the top of the stack.</p>
<p><strong>Length 4</strong></p>
<pre><code>3(5)
</code></pre>
<p>Everyone loves a stack overflow. The above code pushes infinite amounts of fives onto the stack.</p>
<p><strong>Length 3</strong></p>
<pre><code>9()
</code></pre>
<p>This program creates an infinite loop, because infinite loops are very important. <code>9</code> pushes the value 9 onto the stack. <code>()</code> is a loop that repeats as long as the top value on the stack of the line where <code>(</code> is is nonzero.</p>
<p><strong>Length 2</strong></p>
<pre><code>?!
</code></pre>
<p>This handy utility finds the ASCII value of a character. The <code>?</code> command inputs one character and places it atop the stack. At least with the default behavior of the official Python interpreter, input is character-based and output is numeric.</p>
<p><strong>Length 1</strong></p>
<pre><code>!
</code></pre>
<p>Prelude is a stack-based language in which each line of the program has a separate stack. The stacks are conveniently supplied with an infinite amount of zeroes. <code>!</code> is an instruction which outputs the top of the stack. Thus, the program <code>!</code> outputs 0.</p>

<div id="pu242" class="pu"><h1><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131101213211/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Iota/">Jot</a></h1>

<p>Factoid: I can define Jot with 2 upvotes, and prove that it's Turing complete with 8 (not using lengths 4, 6, or 7).</p>

<h2>Length 1</h2>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of two functions in Jot. The first is the empty string, which evaluates to the identity function. The second is <code>1</code>, which is Jot's grouping operator. <code>1</code> evaluates to <code>λxy.[F](xy)</code> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a> notation), where <code>[F]</code> is the program before the <code>1</code> (here, the empty string). So, this program is the function <code>λxy.(λz.z)(xy)</code> which simplifies to <code>λxy.xy</code>.</p>

<h2>Length 2</h2>

<pre><code>10
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are introducing the other symbol in Jot: <code>0</code>. Again if <code>[F]</code> represents the value of the program so far, <code>0</code> evaluates to <code>[F]SK</code>, where <code>S</code> and <code>K</code> are from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic">combinatory logic</a>. I've defined the entire language now.</p>

<h2>Length 5</h2>

<pre><code>11100
</code></pre>

<p>I will now prove that Jot is Turing complete by defining a mapping from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic">combinatory logic</a> to Jot. This Jot program is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic#Examples_of_combinators">K combinator</a>.</p>

<h2>Length 8</h2>

<pre><code>11111000
</code></pre>

<p>This is the S combinator.</p>

<h2>Length 3</h2>

<pre><code>1AB
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are not part of Jot, but rather placeholders for an arbitrary expression. The expression <code>AB</code> in combinatory logic maps to <code>1AB</code> in Jot, with <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> recursively transformed by these three rules. QED</p>

<h2>Length N</h2>

<pre><code>1
10
11
100
101
110
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>Every natural number, expressed in binary, is a valid Jot program. Consequently, I can algorithmically generate more snippets of arbitrary length. Given enough upvotes, I can solve the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting problem</a>.</p>
